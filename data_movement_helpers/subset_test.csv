c5vgydh7sacsubuffaloedu psyrobtwubvmsdccbuffaloedu robert weiss writes in article 93111074840librbabyuvmbitnet librbabyuvmbitnet writes  rick anderson writes  ra   robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying ra things like it is held that cf kermit thread  on what ra exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox       orthodox is a compound word it comes from orthos straight true       right and from doxa opinion doctrine teaching i use orthodox to       refer to right teaching     as opposed to universal or catholic or foursquare gosple i think that    the greek orthodox church would take high offense at your misuse of the    word your version of christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived    you make claims of biblecentricity that are not derivable soley from the    bible  about sixseven months ago you claimed that your primary objection    to the lds was that our doctrine was not biblederived and now this    and other claims can be shown are also not bible interpeting bible                                     right teaching is derived from letting god       speak to us through the bible this can be from reading simple truths       in the scriptures and by using the bible to interpret the bible  9simple truths oh for example     ra who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant       i think that it is apparent from reading the scriptures that are      pertinent       luke 2343 records christs promise to the repentant thief who hung on      an adjacent cross truly i say to you today you will be with me in      paradise but was it not until later that christ rose from the dead      and ascended to heaven if christ himself was not in heaven until      sunday how could the repentant thief have been there with him the      answer lies in the location of paradise when jesus died       apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until easter day          paradise exalted to heaven  9paradise wasnt equal to heaven and now it is yet you claim that  9peeple can not be exalted to heaven nicht wahr        jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and       lazarus as abrahams bosom to which the godly beggar lazarus was      carried by the angels after his decease luke 161931  thus      abrahams bosom referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed      waited till the day of christs resurrection  9when i read the story i found that  abrahams bosom wasnt so much 9a place but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to abraham       it was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of       hades hebrew sheol reserved for believers who had died in the faith      but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of god in heaven      until the price of redemption had actually been paid on calvary or      even that none would precede the presence of jesus back to glory with      the father  9gee this is fairly close to what the lds call spirit prison and what         you have called false doctrine       doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of jesus and the      repentant thief repaired after they each died on friday afternoon but      on sunday after the risen christ had first appeared to mary magdalene      john 2017 and her two companions matthew 289 presumably he then      took up with him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise      including abraham lazarus and the repentant thief we read in      ephesians 48 concerning christ ascending on high he led captivity      captive he gave gifts unto men        vers deleted reproduced below quoted from the sunspot gopher archive                                                  presumably he led the whole      band of liberated captives from hades ie the whole population of      preresurrection paradise up to the glory of heaven     this part is not supported from scripture nor does it support your    claim that the paradise where christ descended was exalted     making such claims on this little evidence ignores the witness of the    scripture  sunephas sun 48 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity sun captive and gave gifts unto men sun  sun xref psalms 6818 sun  thou has ascended on hight thout hast led captivity captive thou has sun  recieved gifts for men yea for the rebellious aslo that the lord god sun  might dwell amoung them sun sunephas sun 49 now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first sun into the lower parts of the earth  410 he that descended is the same sun also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all sun things  411 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and sun some evangelists and some pastors and teachers 412 for the sun perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the sun edifying of the body of christ 413 till we all come in the unity of sun the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man sun unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ 414 that we sun henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about sun with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning sun craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive 415 but speaking the sun truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head     using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison is now changed from    a preeaster postion to posteaster by god postion is not supportable      makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here    ra whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is ra challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ra look at the bible in order to see the truth but what of those who ra see biblical things differently from you       i think that this characterization is faulty whenever my personal       interpretation is questioned i usually give a reason    yes and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading   of the scriptures you have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural    proof need to be crosschecked the referencs that you supply often do   not support your postion if they are read in the context of the scripture         as for those that see things differently please put forward where      there is a valid difference and we can discuss it        i seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one       views the bible is somehow legitimate except or course for the stuff       that i glean from it put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can       have a discussion on that topic but to decry something that i put       forward without putting forward something else to discuss and to       dismiss what i put forward while giving credence to other alleged views      that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious  9how about that those who have been in paradise and have accepted 9the gosple will be judged of jesus christ and then return to the 9presence of god is that somehow different from your expressed view 9that the paradise spoken of or abrahams bosom  ra are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really ra understands it       if you believe that something that i have drawn from scripture is       wrong then please show me from scripture where it is wrong  simply       stating that there are other views is not a proof show it to me from       scripture and then we can go on  9should we go back and discuss your view on why the angle of the lord 9is the lord again

of            astrophysics are bristling with integrals partial            differentials and other fancy mathematics  in this book by            contrast mathematics is conspicuous by its absence except            for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text             larson emphasizes concepts and declares that mathematical            agreement with a theory does not guarantee its conceptual            validity                            dewey b larson was a retired engineer with a bachelor            of science degree in engineering science from oregon state            university  he developed the theory described in his books            while trying to find a way to mathematically calculate the            properties of chemical compounds based only on the elements            they contain                            the universe of motion describes the astrophysical            portions of larsons consistent integrated comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe a kind of            grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists and            astrophysicists claim to be looking for  it is built on two            postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of            space and time                            1 the physical universe is composed entirely of one            component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete            units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time                            2 the physical universe conforms to the relations of            ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are            absolute and its geometry is euclidean                            from these two postulates larson was able to build a            complete theoretical universe from photons and subatomic            particles to the giant elliptical galaxies by combining the            concept of inward and outward scalar motions with            translational vibrational rotational and rotational           vibrational motions  at each step in the development he was            able to match parts of his theoretical universe with            corresponding parts in the real physical universe including            even things not yet discovered  for example in his 1959            book he first predicted the existence of exploding galaxies            several years before astronomers started finding them  they            are a necessary consequence of his comprehensive theory  and            when quasars were discovered he had a related explanation            ready for those also                            as a result of his theory which he called the            reciprocal system larson totally rejected many of the            sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists            including black holes neutron stars degenerate matter            quantum wave mechanics as applied to atomic structure            nuclear physics general relativity relativistic mass            increases relativistic doppler shifts nuclear fusion in            stars and the big bang all of which he considered to be            nothing more than mathematical fantasies  he was very            critical of the ad hoc assumptions uncertainty principles            solutions in principle no other way declarations etc            used to maintain them                            the universe of motion is divided into 31 chapters             it begins with a description of how galaxies are built from            the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters            which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that            accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in            from the antimatter half of the physical universe  galaxy            formation from the mythical big bang is a big mystery to            orthodox astronomers  he then goes on to describe life            cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and            solar systems result from type i supernova explosions of            single stars                            several chapters are devoted to quasars which according            to larson are denselypacked clusters of stars that have            been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies            and are actually traveling faster than the speed of light            although most of that speed is away from us in time                            astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against            observations that contradict their theories would find            larsons explanations quite valuable if considered with an            open mind  for example they used to believe that gamma ray            bursts originated from pulsars which exist primarily in the            plane or central bulge of our galaxy  but the new gamma ray            telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from            all directions uniformly and do not correspond with any            visible objects except for a few cases of directional            coincidence  larsons explanation is that the gamma ray            bursts originate from supernova explosions in the antimatter            half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic            sector  because the antimatter universe exists in a            reciprocal relation to our material universe with the speed            of light as the boundary between them and has three            dimensions of time and only one dimension of space the            bursts can pop into our material universe anywhere seemingly            at random                            larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from            books journal articles and leading physicists and            astronomers  in this book 351 of them are superscripted            with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the            end of the book  for example a quote from the book            astronomy the cosmic journey by william k hartmann            says our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if            we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars            form unfortunately we cannot  larsons book contains            logical consistent explanations of such mysteries that are

77,1289,from neesecerritosedu subject hell distribution world organization cerritos college norwalk ca lines 110      in the king james version of the bible there are three differents words  translated into the word hell  these greek words have totally different  meanings  the words are hades tartaros and gehenna      in bibical usage the greek word hades is used only 11 times in the  new testament and is roughly the equivalent to the old testament word sheol meaning the grave or pit compare acts 227 with psalms 1610  hades may be  likened to a hole in the ground in the bible it has nothing to do with fire      most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the english word hell to translate hades and sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice        why  because when seeing the word hell many readers impute to it the  traditional connotation of an everburning inferno when this was never  remotely intended in the greek language or in old english      in its true bibical usage hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of  the dead but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of  shadowy realm  hades is simply the abode we call the grave  all dead go to  this hell      the second hell of the bible tartaros is mentioned only once in  scripture 2 pet24 for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast  them down to hell tartaros and delivered them into chains of darkness to be  reserved unto judgment      following their rebellion to unseat god from his throne isa141214  rev124 the archangel lucifer now satan and a third of the created angels  now demons were ejected from heaven luke 1018  they were cast down to  tartaros a place or condition of restraint that god has imposed on the  mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment jude 6 1 cor63      tartaros then is a hell that applies only to evil rebellious angels or demons it is interesting that the ancient greeks used this word to describe  the place in which zeus confined the rebellious titans  nowhere in the bible  is there any mention of men being put into this particular hell      the the third word that is translated as hell in the bible is gehenna it comes from the hebrew gai hinnom meaning valley of hinniom  hinnom is a  deep narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of jerusalem      in old testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites including  infant sacrifice it was there that the apostate kings ahaz and manasseh made  their children pass through the fire to the god molech  the rites were  specifically celebrated in tophet the place of abhorrence one of the chief  groves in the valley      king josiah of ancient judah finally put an end to these abominations  he  defiled the valley rendering it ceremonially unclean 2 kings 2310  later  the valley became the cesspool and city dump of jerusalem a repository for  sewage refuse and animal carcasses  the bodies of dispised criminals were  also burned there along with the rubbish  fires burned continuously feeding  by a constant supply of garbage and refuse      aceldama the field of blood purchased with the money judas received for the betrayal of christ matt278 was also in part of the valley of hinnom      so what does this valley called gehenna have to do with hell        in rev1920 the satan inspired political dictator and a miracleworking  religious figure the false prophet working with him will resist the  reestablishment of the government of god by jesus christ at his second coming their fate is revealed by the apostle john and the beast was taken and with  him the false prophet  these both were cast alive into a lake of fire  burning with brimstone          where will this temporary lake of fire this hell be      the prophet isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the beast for  tophet in the valley of hinnom is ordained of old yea for the king it is  prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and wood  the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it isa3033      one thousand years later satan himself will be cast into this rekindled  fiery lake where the beast and false prophet were cast rev2010      but what of the wicked who have died over the millennia  does the bible  say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of  fire      in the sequence of rev20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be  thrown into the lake of fire after satan is cast there rev2015 what will  become of these wicked  will they writhe in flames for eternity        the wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming gehenna  fire on the earth  they wil be consumed annihilated destroyed  this  punishment will be everlasting permanent and final  the bible calls it the  second death rev2014 218 from which there is no possibility of a  further resurrection      the bible does teach eternal punishment but not eternal punishing                                 the prophet malachi provides a graphic description for behold the day  cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do  wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up 41  to the righteous god says that the wicked shall be ashes under the  soles of your feetmal43      gehenna was a place of destruction and death not a place of living  torture  jesus was talking to jews who understood all about this gehenna or  valley of hinnom  utter destruction by fire was complete  nothing was left  but ashes       every text in the bible translated from this greek word gehenna means  complete destruction not living torture not eternal life in torment  the  bible says in romans 623 the wages of sin is death not eternal life in  torture  the punishment revealed in the bible is death the cessation of  life           eternal life is the gift of god ,3

call god abba  christians therefore will try to find what it is that their lord commands them and discovering it will feel obligated to do it or to confess their failure readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon such as slaves of christ  the point is that adherents of a religion will read the texts whether classified as inspired or not that are held up as models in an effort to find application to their own situations  this practice ranges from devotional reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon ical scripture as the word of god  and at the highest pitch this leads to a question of whether we can find in inspired scripture something that can act as absolute guidance for our actions  the problem is in finding out just what it is our lord commands  i am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which christians have looked for these commands namely christian tradition  that is not because i reject tradition but because my primary audience in this essay is protestants who deny tradition a determinative value in favor of the witness of scripture  the question i want to deal with is what commandments can we find from our lord in scripture  and that turns out to be a hard question   if any of my protestant inquisitors would like to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition i can accomodate them  unlike most protestants episcopalians admit claims from a scripture b reason and c tradition on roughly equal standing   earlier in john than my quote above we read john 1334 i give you a new  commandment love one another  this is the only place in the nt where christians are given an explicit commandment with the context commenting on its imperative mode pronouncement by jesus  at the same meal so we readers infer since it is not in john but in the synoptics jesus says take this bread this is my body  mark 1422 cf matthew 2626 luke 2219 1 corinthians 1124  the mode is imperative greek labete and hence this too is a commandment  in both cases we have to infer that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples  because we judge the evangelists point in mentioning it with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead is that we are expected to follow this as a commandment from our lord  in the case of communion pauls mention at least this is probably true of the evangelists also implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to bind christians to the original command to his disciples as a continuing commandment to the christian community  i am entirely comfortable with this inference but i must point out that it is there between us and the occasion on which jesus spoke the command i take it as a clear inference at the very least the evangelists notion that all christians are called to love one another in jesus command directed at the disciples  but i have to call attention to the inference the command cannot apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a disciple of christ  all reading of scripture has to make such inferences to get any sense out of the text whatsoever  this is a general problem in reading these texts  we cannot read them at all without our own understanding of our native languages in which we normally read the translated texts and without some appreciation of the original context and at points the original languages when english misleads us i am going to presume in what follows that we have the general problem of how to read scripture under control  i dont really think this is true but it will suffice for my current purposes   i will address only the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in  questions at that level only introduce more reser vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done  among the reasons we have for seeing johns agapate allelou as a general commandment not merely an instruction by jesus to this disciples on that one occasion and one linking it to the synoptic great commandment is that we have criticism from jesus about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with  in matthew 543ff we read you have learnt how it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy  but i say to you love your enemies  in fact the leviticus context quoted does not say hate your enemy  it is merely the common human presumption and leviticus is at pains to say that the love should extend to strangers amongst the people of israel  luke in expanding on this same q context goes on to have jesus say even sinners love those who love them 627 all of this suggests quite strongly id say  that limiting the scope of the new commandment is not quite what jesus has in mind  in short inference leads me to generalizing the actual text to a command that is in force on christians and with objects not limited to other christians  trickier than the agapate allelou or institution of communion there is the case of the great commission where matthew 10 mark 6 the twelve are sent out to evangelize proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand  the verb is imperative kerussete but the context is rather specific to the twelve and there are further specifiers as in do not turn your steps to pagan territory and do not enter any samaritan town  the lukan parallels are even more specific to jesus final journey to jerusalem which make it harder to see this generalizing to all christians than the previous examples  that hasnt prevented christians from making such an inference what i have to call attention to is that such inference is not justified in the text nor unlike the first two cases i cite by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader  still paul seems to have felt obliged to proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand even contrary to jesus instructions to the 12  to the gentiles to the ends of the earth  so christians after him have also taken this as a commandment in the sense of john 1415  do i accept this  i dont know  it is surely rather speculative  but you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext  christians may infer a general commandment applicable to all from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion  i do not necessarily object to this kind of generalization  but i insist that people who make it must have an understanding that they are reasoning at some considerable length from what we actually have in scripture  there are assumptions involved in this reasoning and these are not themselves scriptural though people will do their best to justify their assumptions by other references to scripture  which simply adds more inference into the mix  lets move on to the great commandment  that we should love god with our whole hearts and minds and souls  this is perhaps the synoptic equivalent of johns agapate allelou  and yet  it is not presented as a commandment in our texts  rather the context is controversy with the pharisees  to cite matthew 2234ff  9but when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees 9they got together and to disconcert him one of them put a question 9master which is the greatest commandment of the law  it is by no means obvious here though i accept it as such that jesus answer is meant to be a commandment to christians  he is answering a polemic from his enemies   marks account in  122834 casts the answer in a far more positive light as so the scribe in this version says far more important than any holocaust i need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice forget the nazis for this or sacrifice  luke is intermediate  he has a lawyer posing the question to disconcert jesus and gets the good samarian parable for his pains  luke 102537   the contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing no inferences   in no account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on christians  though i think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that jesus thinks it to be so  the point is that our mental gears have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what we are commanded to do by jesus  and all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of jesus use of the torah in the all quite different gospel accounts and the application of such a context to us  the different contexts among the synoptics are curious  it should be noted that only in luke do we get the fixing of this command by the parable of the good samaritan  we may look for an analogous intent in matthew where 712 gives the golden rule as the meaning of the law and the prophets and where we may also hear an echo of hillel saying the same a generation before jesus  if we make these associations which i think are entirely reasonable we are  again  indulging in inference  the texts do not explicitly support us rather we read the texts as having this kind of interrelationship  current literary theory calls this intertextuality  my discussion of why the agapate allelou has to apply beyond the  community of the disciples and beyound the circle of christian believers applies again here to buttress a conclusion that this is despite the presentation not saying so explicitly a commandment to christians few christians would disagree with my conclusions  but i must point out that they are conclusions they depend on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply not present in the texts themselves  the contextual problem keeps coming up more and more severely as we look at those sayings of jesus that are not so universally taken by christians as  commandments  and we get some really hard cases  take divorce  mark is  pretty clear the man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her   1011 cf luke 1618   except that matthew has an escape clause  except in the case of fornication 531  this seems to be a rather clear commandment whether or not we take matthews reservation and some christians to this day take it so  but some dont at least in practice  this is rather peculiar it is not as if jesus were not explicit about this whereas he says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over  how is it possible if the commands of christ are clear that matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition  im going to continue this examination into evermurkier waters but this is enough to start with  the theme is finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference our inferences are informed by our assumptions that is our own cultural biases  i have so far identified a very few commandments that are generally accepted by all christians  and yet in these already some of the difficulties start to surface  it is these difficulties i want to discuss in my next essay on this topic  the divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties i see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn me with spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soccouples or misclegal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce or demanding that us law refuse to allow it or refuse unrepentant divorcees places in their churches   that is not to say that divorce doesnt enter into  consideration in general  it is most definitely a matter of concern in even the most liberal church circles  for example a wildly liberal episcopalian priest of my aqauintence in a wildly liberal diocese has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a private secular ceremony before a judge so that the public ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing examination by officials who would just as soon not take on this role of interpreting the commands we are faced with as christians  this in a church that was effectively created by a famous divorce    michael l siemon99i say you are gods sons of the mlspanixcom999most high all of you nevertheless      or 999you shall die like men and fall

something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images  doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to 24bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations  think about what you are saying here the 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour  i suppose you dont know what about we have discussed we discussed about errors in xv 221 which shows images only as 8bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it  look be consistent first you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error  so i post and asy it is not a bug it is meant to be like that  so you post and say it is not a bug you never said it was i have misunderstood etc now you are saying  we discussed about errors in xv 221 which shows images only as 8bit  if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a lot easier    so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv  that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didnt tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place  eh sorry i dont understand what you are saying here i am aware that english is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning but this paragraph defeats me  gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as i presented theres no need make tricks from 8bitquantized image back to 24 bit image  yes as i originally said global changes are easily possible  but this statement contradicts what you said earlier   i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image    how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated  ok youre writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors  your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit  no i dont think so actually   you were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv by quantising manipulating the colours in the colour editor then somewhow applying these changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv xv lets you edit individual colours where is this sudden jumping off the topic  my solution doesnt work because theres no colormap withing real 24bit image   yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file   you see user see 24bit image going back to 8bit is silly  i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean  about changing individual colors in 8bitquantizedrasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized  small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image   what are you saying   xv allows this feature but i dont recommend to use it with the mentioned type images  ah now we see thew problem first you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images then i point out problems with this now you are saying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem   moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes   not sure what you are saying here certainly one can make local changes  in full 24bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have 8bit screen theres need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified because user dont see full 24bit image theres need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area  selecting individual color is possible from that  yes that is one possible approach i would find a program that took such an approach clumsy however  ok i dont have thought very much 24bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen  well here we agree  you have not thought it through very much you dont seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next ok we all have off days  perhaps you should step back and think this one through  yes again what is was wrong with xv  it saved 8bitquantizedrasterized images as 24bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that  as i said in the last post jpeg is a compression algorithm it is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression i fail to see what the problem is you have not proposed any workable alternatives  also human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image   speak for yourself you are the only person i have met or spoken to who having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 8 bit image palette  perhaps that is why you yused the singular  say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same   look next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel  it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit image xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit file you are the only person who claims this is confusing  so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work  design error  is a design error the same as a bug   read my lips xv is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images it lets you import other images it shows i would say a good deal of thought about the human interface and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for it makes no false claims  i have heard xv were designed first for 8bit imagesfiles but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design  if you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post them so  far you have not done so  so even all screen images are 8bit the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily instead of 8bit  argh after all this a comment like that very easily ok go ahead and code it if it is so easy  or alternatively look up the terms import and nonreversible transformation  before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals  however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesnt solve the problem americans the lift is just an example   i think this is a bit of an exageration  what you are actually saying is you got into a lift elevator if you are in the states   and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up everyone else had no problem now you are trying to sue the manufacturer  well my text may be a bit hard reading   you bet  hopefully you suggeeded to read it  mostly leaving aside the language issue however it betrays some very wooly thinking as you yourself

few that are legend  many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but  they dont meet the other criterions  andrew  the myth to which i refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have created to make religion appear absurd rather than approach religion including christainity in a rational manner and debating its claims as the are stated atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then hold the religious accountable for beliefs they dont have what is more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist  bill   divine justice according to the most fundamental doctrines of  christianity when the first man sinned he was at that time the   you accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to  launch your own xtian mythology  this time meeting all the  requirements of myth   heres a good example of of what i said above read the post again i said acoording to  which means i am referring to christian doctrine as i understand it if i am speaking for myself youll know it my purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of christain doctrines since it seemed germane  bill   with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it  means when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and  dont know what he wants they contradict the bible which clearly says  that everyone knows the authority of the bible is its claim to be   should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting  it across  you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesnt  make it any more credible to me  if the bible says that everyone knows thats clearly reason  to doubt the bible because not everyone knows your alleged  gods alleged existance  again i am paraphrasing christian doctrine which is very clear on this point your dispute is not with me   bill   refuted while the specieswide condemnation is justified those that  claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is  unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is  no excuse   1 no they dont have to ignore the bible  the bible is far  from universally accepted  the bible is not a proof of god  it is only a proof that some people have thought that there  was a god  or does it prove even that  they might have been  writing it as series of fiction shortstories  as in the  case of dionetics  assuming the writers believed it the  only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it  and thats ignoring the problem of whether or not all the  interpretations and biblicalphilosophers were correct   2 there are people who have truly never heard of the bible   3 again read the faq  1 here again you miss the point the bible itself is not the point its what it contains it makes no difference who accpets the bible or even whos unaware of its existence christians hold that it applies universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of god  2 see above  3 if you read my post with same care as read the faq we wouldnt be having this conversation  bill   freedom you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to  ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known  in both cases that an atheist cant accept the evidence means only   bzztwrong answer  gravity is directly there  it doesnt stop exerting a direct and  rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it  god on the  other hand doesnt generally show up in the supermarket except  on the tabloids  god doesnt exert a rationally undeniable influence  gravity is obvious gods arent  as i said the evidence is there you just dont accept it here at least we agree  bill   secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god so  much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason  always comes back to the question of god in every generation and in   no human reason hasnt always come back to the existance of  god it has usually come back to the existance of god  in other words it doesnt generally come back to the xtian  god it comes back to whether there is any god  and in much  of oriental philosophic history it generally doesnt pop up as  the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces  are and which ones are out there  from a worldwide view  human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to  be andor what forces are currently in control  a natural  tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful  thinking  yes human reason does always come back to the existence of god were having this discussion are we not  bill   i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently  reasonable that divine justice is just and human nature is much  different than what atheists think it is whether you agree or not   you certainly are not correct on human nature  you are at  the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric  approach  try looking at the outside world as well

read the whole thing  you continue to miss the point  skinnersp94csrduiucedu gregg skinner writes  parkerehsn17cenuiucedu robert s parker writes  deletions  soapbox on  if its ok to pay for legal procedures with govt money then lets get the  government to pay for counselling that provides abortion alternatives   lets get the government to pay for adoption fees  lets get the government  to pay for all the things that make abortion necessary  why not  they  are certainly legal procedures  counselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as biased as counselling that only provides abortion information  how about providing counselling that will give a woman help in finding what she is comfortable with  your adoptionfunding idea may be a good one  any idea if it is feasable   the only way hell is involved is that it is going to be a good skiing resort  before i give in to paying for abortions  i believe it is wrong and i  wont pay for it without a gripe  im not for making them unlawful id  rather spend money on saving lives than a bunch of investigations and court  hearings and all this other crap we are spending our time on   you know whos really cleaning up on all this abortion stuff  lawyers  i  say lets pass laws to make adoption cheaper easier and infinitely more  supportive of the birth mother  lets eradicate the stigma reduce the  cost pay the price for life  making adoption easier on the birthmother may help reduce abortion but it will not eliminate the need for it  abortion is not done just because the mother cant care for the child and doesnt feel good about giving it to strangers  abortion is done because the mother can not afford the pregnancy  soapbox off   a person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights of another person    cool enough  youll have more trouble defining the terms in that statement  than getting people to agree to it  for example i perceive i have a right  not to participate in what i feel is murder  i dont think the government  should either  on the other hand since we are having trouble proving that  it is murder there is no right to stop someone from doing it if they so  choose either by legal means or harassment  of course persuasion is  allowed but watch that line between persuasive and harassing  the second part is a definition of a person  a simplistic explanation is that a person is a member of society  most normal adult human beings are good examples of people  most children over two years old are people as well  the simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation with them  it is actually more complicated than that but i have no desire to spend the time it would take to explain it to you  read the thread why is bodily autonomy so important for more explanation and justification  but why is your definition authoritative enough for the whoe us  surely you can understand there are other definitions with equal right of  consideration  then please justify why being human automatically makes something valuable and why that includes the unborn   if the government refused to fun abortions due to the qualms of a minority of the population then it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of babies whose mothers wanted an abortion but could not afford one and now that baby will also require care for 18 years  true  that needs to be fixed  it is part of the problem  if clinton has a  medical program to get underway let him address this too  it is cheaper  in the long run to save lives later they will be productive members of  society  at least if his plan works  no they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society  even if they do that is many years in the futureuntil which they are a burden on someone or society  there is also the matter of the mother  forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent her from being a productive member of society  actually i was refering to the minority that objects to abortion not those who object to federal funding  i admit i did not say it very clearly and apologize for that   to refuse to fund abortions  is to remove that choice from some women and add the additional burden to society for no reason  no  this is really flawed logic  it would be like me saying i was born  with a disfigured face and i want cosmetic repair  it is  discriminatory that i cannot make that choice and so you must pay for it    that a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or  otherwise that someone else should foot the bill sic for that choice  ok look  its like this  we are footing the bill  maybe they will take choice a  maybe they will take choice b  maybe they will take choice c  they cant afford any one of them  if they take choice a wed have to pay them say 5  if they take choice b it would cost us 20  if they take choice c it will cost us 20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next 18 years  which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay for  now some people happen not to like choice a  other people happen not to like choice c paying for it that is  c has been around and paid for for years  even though it means we spend a lot of money we cant in conscience refuse to pay for it  now a has been around and is perfectly legal but it hasnt been funded in the past  now a is going to be funded but some people object  they dont like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice a  so we could refuse to fund a at all  then those women who cant afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice b or c which will cost all of us more money  most of us dont see any reason at all why more money should be spent to the effect of removing personal choice from some women  the alternative is to fund a if that is what the mother chooses  we will also still fund b and even c if that is what the mother chooses  however some women will certainly choose a and that will then save us 15 we otherwise would have had to spend  your taxes are not being raised to fund a choice you object they are being lowered because we will fund a choice that is legal despite your objections to it  actually your taxes are not really going to go down as im sure you would point out  but the amount that is saved in that area can help out in anotherlike our massive debt   if you disagree then give us some reasons  given that abortion is legal and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the population  it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford them who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you would force upon them  i refuse to pay more taxes to remove choice from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure  what  i say objection to the procedure is irrelevant  uncle bill doesnt pay for  breast augmentation facelifts etc  why abortions  its elective  surgery    those other procedures you mention only cost money  there is no savings in other procedures that would be required down the road without them in fact there could be additional costs down the road because of them this is quite different from the case of abortion  as for your argument you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making  it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too so you  are just as guilty of removing a choice by withholding funds  think about  it  a poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded whats she  gonna do  what choice have your plans given her  your kind of double talk really makes me ill  this is bullshit  we are not refusing to make the alternative affordable too  if we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth then your statement would make sense  but that is not the case so it doesnt if clinton tried to block funding for prenatal care and delivery or left it out of his healthcare plan i would certainly object  i would also be quite surprised   prochoice  ha  proabortion really fits in your case  yes but probably not your definition of it or for the reasons you think  if youre gonna fund one choice you have to fund them all at the very  least  you stupid fuck  we do want to fund all the choices  you are the one who wants to not fund all the choices          imho if we fund the adoption choice right meaning not just  throwing money at it but cutting costs esp legal costs we wont need  abortion anymore  your humble opinion is still wrong  even with easy adoption there is still the fact that pregnancy takes several months  months in which a young woman could need to be getting an education  like finishing high school entering college finishing college getting a jobthings that are much harder to do if you have to take a break for a few monthsthings that have a massive impact on her future productivity   have a right to life  a fetus is not a person  you can not have a conversation with them    ah  lets kill the mentally incompetant as well  or how about people we  just dont like since we cant have a conversation with them  you can have a conversation with the mentally incompetant  and even though you personally may refuse to have a conversation with people you just dont like it is still possible for others to have a conversation with them  it is not possible for anyone to have a conversation with a fetus  they are not biologically independent    nor was my son at the age of 6 weeks  he was breastfed and would not take a bottle  just what does biologically independent mean  ill be happy to  punch any definition full of loopholes  he was still biologically independent  at least to the same extent you are now  he consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner  he breathed his own air  a fetus on the other hand gets its nutrients already digested by the mother  it gets its oxygen from the mother as well  that is not biologically independent  their awareness is questionable    aha you admit it is questionable  yet you are willing to kill it even if  it may be very aware  i suggest you rethink your viewpoint  awareness is only part of what makes a member of society  it is the minimal conceivable requirement yet many people seem to think that something without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing of a true member of society  i keep asking but i still havent seen a real justification for why the life of a nonsentient creature should be worth the suffering of a sentient being  i havent read every response on the threads ive been asking on yet so well see if i see one later  they have no experiences in the real world to make up a personality  this is also true of

122,279,from mleepostroyalroadsca malcolm lee subject the laws of god was re a kind and loving god organization royal roads military college victoria bc lines 102   in article 1r4e63inn2kbowlcsrvuidahoedu lanphi872moscowuidahoedu rob lanphier writes   these are two conflicting statements  to say one is a clarification of the  other is a breach of logic  i dont mind people shifting their position on  an issue  it irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change  was made  what about deuteronomy 222025  is it wrong now  did jesus  change that     if anything he clarified the law such as in that quote you made  in the   following verses jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon   the law giving clearer meaning to what god intended    sure he does this  however he doesnt address the notion of stoning  nonvirgin brides because this needs no clarification  are you going to  deny that deuteronomy 222025 is not patently clear in its intent   i see what you are getting at or at least i think i do  correct me if i am mistaken but i think you are asking me if i still believe that we should uphold all of the laws pertaining to capital punishment for such things as adultery rape and other heinous crimes  as you may recall jesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress who was caught in the act and brought before jesus  and his reply let he who is without sin cast the first stone  jesus does not deny the sentence that is to due for this violation of the law  what do you think of this      i think you will agree with me that there are in todays world a lot of   modernday pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe   in it  what good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart    ill agree that there is a lot of modern day pharisees that know the bible  from end to end and dont believe in it  depending on how they use this  knowledge they can be scary  they can argue any position they desire and  back it up with selected parts of the bible  such pharisees include david  koresh and adolph hitler  i will qualify this by saying i dont know if  they actually believed what they were preaching but the ends certainly  made the means look frightening   agreed      however just as scary are those that dont know much of the bible but  believe every word  in fact this is probably scarier since there are far  more of these people from what ive seen  in addition they are very easy  to manipulate by the aforementioned pharisees since they dont know enough  to debate with these people    agreed also  if one is to use the bible as a reference one must always be open to different interpretations  as a christian i have the spirit of god to verify what i believe in the word  if what the spirit tells me is not backed up in scripture then the spirit i am communicating with is not of god  after all jesus tells us to test the spirits to know for sure that it is from god     christianity is not just a set of rules its a lifestyle that changes ones   perspectives and personal conduct  and it demands obedience to gods will    no it demands obedience to a book  if god came down and personally told  me how i should behave then i would say that i would be doing gods will  by doing it  however if preachers pastors and evangelists tell me to  obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to  two millenia even longer for the ot even if i follow everything in it  with my heart i could scarcely be honest with myself by saying im doing  the will of god   i obey what the spirit of god tells me to do  the spirit will not violate anything that is written in the bible because that is the word of god  i do not worship pastors preachers my wife my mother or my father  what they tell me does not carry the weight of what god tells me to do and his commands are rienforced in the bible     some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not  that is   their choice and i have to respect it because god respects it too    well if god respects it so much how come there is talk in the bible about  eternal damnation for nonbelievers  i see little respect eminating from  the god of the bible  i see a selfish and spiteful god   eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting god  if you choose to jump off a cliff you can hardly blame god for you  going splat at the bottom  he knows that if you choose to jump that  you will die but he will not prevent you from making that choice  in fact he sent his son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what lies below  to prove that point jesus took that plunge himself but he being god was able to rise up again  i have seen the example of christ and have  chosen not to jump and im trying to tell you not to jump or else youll  go splat   you dont have to listen to me and i wont stop you if you decide to jump i only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge  you owe it to yourself  i dont like seeing anyone go splat  god be with you   malcolm lee   ,3

149,1205,from bskendignetcomcom brian kendig subject re is it good that jesus died organization starfleet headquarters san francisco lines 143  jasonsatlastelecom jason smith writes bskendignetcomcom brian kendig writes    and i felt torn when i began to disagree with a lot of what the bible  and my priests told me   did it start getting a little uncomfortable  did your style start feeling a bit cramped  yes thats exactly what i felt  my heart just felt that what i was being taught was wrong  a basically good message but framed in errors  i could not with a clear conscience accept that women were somehow not equal to men that homosexuals are guilty of their lifestyle that pride in ones work is a bad thing that jesus died for me  i dont want anybody to die for me especially as an impersonal act where the person cant possibly even know me well enough to really know if im worth dying for or not  i was never able to accept the bit about jesuss death being a good thing  if that means that im just not comprehending a basic message of christianity then so be it  maybe im just not compatible with christianity  i just refuse to follow rules blindly and since i cant even convince myself that your god even exists in the way you describe it ive got to just follow my own conscience in these matters  i know how that goes  knowing i couldnt and didnt want to  live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me outside too    dont think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because i dont believe in your god  i will not steal and i will not murder  not because i fear divine repudiation but because these just arent in my character  you may think theres nothing keeping me from just running around on a murdering spree stealing things when im able insulting people for the heck of it because im not answerable to anyone but youd be wrong  im answerable to myself  a life like that would be a cheap life i happen to want to earn respect in myself  till i met the man that is  my initial break with christianity came after a lot of soulsearching and a lot of wondering why i could no longer feel the presence of god with me  i finally decided that i had once felt this presence just as i had felt my mighty teddy bear beside me when i was a little tyke protecting me from the monsters under the bed  that i had believed in god just as i had believed in the teddy bear as something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers  since then ive never abandoned the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity does exist  but there are a few times when in my darkened room by my bed i have set aside everything i believe for a moment and called out to whatevers out there because i want to know the truth even if it means abandoning everything i know  and i have not yet received an answer   only when i truly listened to myself body and soul did i realize  that i could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being  christian  there is a higher truth in the universe and christianity  just aint it  any suggestions on what or who or where it might be and why  nope  it may well be unknowable  scientists have suggested that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself the threedimensional universe may be mapped onto a fourdimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a twodimensional plane onto a threedimensional sphere see sphereland the sequel to flatland for more thoughts on this  our entire universe might just be an electron in a four dimensional universe which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that and so on and so forth until the variables become too much for us to even speculate on  that is theres no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to be so theres no reason at all to believe that your god exists nor had anything to do with it  ok you may say so now if im just being good am i doing good enough  thats for you to answer  if you feel youre doing fine then go ahead and ignore us foolish little christians  we can present what weve seen and experienced providing our witness but it isnt up to us to make that seed sprout    christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy book and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe guilt trips insinuations that im without morals arguments from disbelief how can you possibly believe that god doesnt exist and so forth  all im asking is for you to convince me  i want to be convinced but its not going to be easy  so much as you dont like what were selling there just may be someone out there that can identify with it  methinks you could give us all a  lesson in tolerance and back off  having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside i view it as harmful in many ways  it preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives and once its got these people it teaches them to have pity and sometimes starkly intolerant of others who do not share these views  maybe youll say that your religion doesnt teach that  but ive got to judge christianity from the christians i know  i feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in ones self and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that  so i hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people think  i want christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever and i want people who are considering christianity to realize that christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy fulfilled life  i have known some very nice christians who have done some very nice things  i think what sets these people apart from the general masses is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong and they know the weaknesses of their religion yet they still decide to believe but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think any less of people who dont agree with them  obviously the debate on the veracity and reliability of the source of the christians faith is far from conclusive notwithstanding how vehemently we propose otherwise  precisely my point  youve still not given me a reason to be a christian instead of a buddhist or a moslem   the nice thing about religion if you lose yourself deeply enough in  it is that eventually youll be able to feel justified in most  anything you want to do  yknow your right  fortunately for everyone around me im not religious   im a christian   just as the moslems arent religious and the buddhists arent religious  who is religious then      brian kendig                             je ne suis fait comme aucun   bskendignetcomcom

debating against line noise  sometimes i get tired and  sometimes i have other things id rather do  again this is usenet and life is tough all over  youre going to have to deal with it  e youre starting to get personally insulting i may not even put your name     in the hat in future  thats supposed to be a threat  no thats a simple statement and an assertion that i am not answerable to those who offer me baseless insults  for example those who accuse me  of lying about my personal beliefs while also complaining that i dont answer their questions    like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there if only everything would be so easy  what almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there because to all intents and purposes it is there  we had that argument for one your claim that everyone senses it is not founded and you have been asked to give evidence for it often and then the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it is there unless evidence against it has been found  i have no problem with the second statement  i have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that freedom is valuable  the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey and was offered by some other people too essentially that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as freedom  its a good point and im thinking about it   your trick is to say i feel a is not right and so do many i know therefore a is absolutely right it neglects the possibility that these people consider a to be right as an effect of the same process restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject of that process in other words refutes it you make the ontological claim you have to prove it  nonsense  my trick is to say  i feel that a is better than b and so  does almost any disinterested person i ask  best evidence is therefore  that a really is better than b subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b and that the resulting system of values is selfconsistent  now get this  really is better is an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model it may or may not correspond to something true  it is nonetheless a useful assumption  far more useful than the equally assumed relativist  trick to wit  i feel that a is better than b and so does almost any disinterested person i ask  however if even one person disagrees that a is better than b or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of a and b then it is the case that b is better than a for that person and nothing more can be said    i say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise a cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise b eg a terrorist  to do that would be to claim that  a supermajoritys carefully considered morality would be better than the  terrorists  which would of course be true but a nono for an ethical relativist  to claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion  for a similar argument i sense morality is subjective it does not hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by others  if you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively wrong and it turns out not to be the case for you  of course this is possible  it is neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence against objectivism except sometimes in a pragmatic sense  it serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to judgements is absolute and as long as you dont provide evidence for that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to believe your hypothesis  ive done this freedom with the proviso that i still have to  answer jons objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning  further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective you would have to show that it is independent of humans or the attributes above look quite misleading  not really  what evidence is there that anything exists independently of humans  youll be hard pressed to find any that isnt logically equivalent when applied to values  an analogous set of premises would be  premise 1  some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest             route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance             of the estate and down the malahide road  premise 2  i checked it out and found that the shortest route from my             which is much closer  you would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my house to a bar yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim using premises which are logically no different    no morals are a matter of belief so far the people still believe that the shortest way is through the main entrance no agreement on belief here and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it is the shortest way indeed in other words  your analogy works only when one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place if not it is a fallacy  and if this were an argument for objectivism youd be right  it isnt though its a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument against objectivism nor argument for relativism  your gimmick is to assume in the first place that values arent real and to use this to prove that values arent real  in other words you beg the question against me    frank odwyer                                  im not hatching that odwyersseie

1sti5kinnoq4gapcaltechedu palmerccocaltechedu david m palmer writes garyke4zvuucp gary coffman writes lack of a skeleton means that muscles have to actively resist gravity at all times on land rather than supplying only balancing forces that means that much more energy would be required for the creature to function the bones also supply leverage points for pushing and lateral movement thats why you dont find large  active boneless creatures on land  hydraulics can make rigid tubes  no energy required just for support  hydraulics also allow a creature to produce large forces with weak muscles using the principle of a hydraulic jack rather than a lever  this is one of those yes but things its true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube but even at 2000 psi levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily though its straighton compressive strength is high and its torsional  resistance increase is practically nil on the other grasping member  theres no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature tree roots  are an example given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure increases  its interesting to note that on land creatures are either two legged or 4 legged with tiny insects having 6 or 8 legs but never 3 legged though that would be a  stable configuration it can be argued that 2 legged creatures   kangaroos are 3legged  the specific number of limbs a creature has is an accident of evolution it is hard to make changes in some structures  the panda has a thumb plus as many fingers as its ancestors five on each hand but the thumb is a modified wristbone rather than a modified finger and extra fingers are much more common than extra limbs especially fullyfunctional ones  kangaroos 3limbed i dont think so if you take the view that the tail is a limb then monkeys and kangaroos are 5limbed i think the tail is a different kind of structure grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion i dont know much about panda thumbs so ill ask is it opposable  thermodynamic considerations of surfacevolume relationships would seem to dictate that active complex creatures  stay in a size range similar to what we see about us 6 inch tall intelligent aliens seem unlikely as do those much larger than the elephant  why cant a lemur or a brontosaurus be intelligent  yes i know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus but so far space aliens are also mythical  well i wont say flat out that they cant be intelligent but ill bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why i dont think its likely first let me say that when i say intelligent i mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with or greater than human tool use and tool building ie assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter  its enviroment in a planned way it will do so thats certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence but it will suffice for a putative technological alien  now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought but its generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity this is generally determined by the number of neuron cells and their interconnections so a creature the size of a lemur wouldnt have enough neurons to support complex thought this argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur theres room for a large brain though no indication that one ever developed one reason this may be true is neuronic speed the electrochemical messages  that trigger neurons require time to propagate this makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures so theres little selection pressure for such brains instead a simpler distributed network evolves this doesnt rule out intelligent dinosaurs but it points in that direction  then there are the thermodynamic arguments a tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because its internal heat is rapidly lost due to its high surface to volume ratio i contend that a creature that must spend most of its time and energy feeding wont have the time to develop and exercise intelligence that argument may be somewhat weak the dinosaurs problem is the reverse it must moderate its heat production  because its high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat  im assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function so creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based that tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded but for a creature the size of a brontosaur its activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat whales are similar size but they can reject heat to the ocean a much more efficient sink than air i suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary ie monkey curiousity i doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity  gary   gary coffman ke4zv              you make it      gatechwa4meike4zvgary destructive testing systems     we break it

214,777,from nyedacnsvaxuwecedu david nye subject re after 2000 years can we say that christian morality is organization university of wisconsin eau claire lines 62  reply to frankd012s658uucp frank odwyer   the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established  if we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world   this can be avoided in at least two ways 1 by leaving the good undefined since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a reply   if the good is undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that they know innately what is right you are back to subjectivism   2 by defining the good solely in terms of evaluative terms   ditto here  an evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the part of the person making it   at this point the objectivist may talk of selfevident truths   pretty perceptive that prof flew   but can he deny the subjectivists claim that selfevidence is in the mind of the beholder   of course by denying that subjectobject is true dichotomy   please explain how this helps  i dont see your argument   if not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true   if nothing then no moral judgements are true  this is a thing that is commonly referred to as nihilism  it entails that science is of no value irrepective of the fact that some people find it useful  how anyone arrives at relativismsubjectivism from this argument beats me   this makes no sense either  flew is arguing that this is where the objectivist winds up not the subjectivist  furthermore the nihilists believed in nothing except science materialism revolution and the people   the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself to hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity   and if those preferences should include terrorism that moral opinion is not true  likewise if the preferences should include noterrorism that moral opinion is not true  why should one choose a set of preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes noterrorism  oh no reason  this is patently absurd   and also not the position of the subjectivist as has been pointed out to you already by others  ditch the strawman already and see my reply to mike cobbs root message in the thread societal basis for morality   david nye nyedacnsvaxuwecedu  midelfort clinic eau claire wi this is patently absurd but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities  bertrand russell ,0

supports 8 15 16 24 bits display    4 this program is memory greedy if you dont have enough memory      the performance is poor    5 if you want to save 8 bits image         try gif then tifflzw then targa then sun raster then bmp then        if you want to save 24 bits image lossless        try tifflzw or targa or ilbm or sun raster        no one is better for true 24bits image    6 i recommend jpeg for storing 24 bits images even 8 bits images    7 not all subroutines are fully tested    8 this document is not well written if you have any problem suggestion      comment about this program

the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made  which affect the lives of innocent people  but i do regret the   circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret the  suffering caused by those decisions    im afraid im going to have to kill you  dont worry though as a loving christian i guarantee that i will regret the fact that i have to kill you although i wont regret the actual killing   if we hadnt intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would  have been appeasement    right  but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action  or  are you just setting up a strawman    im not setting up a strawman at all  if you want to argue against the  war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep  kuwait  false dichotomy   diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective  thats because they werent even attempted   but what about those who didnt support hitlers dreams of conquest  its  not as if they democratically voted for all his policies  the nsdap got  43  in the elections of 1933 and that was the last chance the german   people got to vote on the matter    they suffered along with the rest  why does this bother you so much  you want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were maimed or killed by bombing at the end of ww2 when it was far from clear that such bombing was necessary   the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect  many  innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others  it it regretable  but thats thewayitis  and whyisitthatway  who set things up to be that way   this was happening before the gulf war  why didnt we send in the bombers   to east timor  why arent we sending in the bombers now    probably because were not the saviors of the world  we cant police each  and every country that decides to selfdestruct or invade another  no just the ones that have oil  or the ones that look like they might make a success of communism   nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or  some other places  i dont see that getting un forces to east timor is any harder than getting them to iraq              tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed  amnesty  international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china    why arent we stopping them  in fact why are we actively sucking up to  them by trading freely with them    tell me how we could stop them and ill support it  i for one do not  agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it  i agree that it is deplorable  fine  write to your congressman and to president clinton  chinas status as most favoured nation comes up for renewal in june  point out that the us shouldnt be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime  i doubt anything will happen  clintons keener on trade sanctions against europe   unbelievable comments about the rodney king case deleted    the media is not totally monolithic  even though there is a prevailing  liberal bias programs such as the macneillehrer news hour try to give  a balanced and fair reporting of the news  there are even conservative  sources out there if you know where to look  hurrah for rush  any idea how many kill files you just ended up in   i an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people    you a supposed christian are arguing that its ok to kill innocent people  so long as you get some guilty ones as well    hardly  i didnt say that its a good thing tm to kill innocent people  if the end is just  unfortunately we dont live in a perfect world and  there are no perfect solutions  if one is going to  resist tyranny then  innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die  i didnt say  it is ok  it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary  the ends justify the means eh   you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that i  am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the  war      you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist  the same tired old misunderstanding  moral relativism means that there is no objective standard of morality  it doesnt mean you cant judge other peoples morals  christ on a bike how many times have we tried to hammer that into your head   wheres your christian love  wheres your absolute morality  oh how   quick you are to discard them when it suits you  as ivan stang would say  jesus would puke    one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action  even this discourse in this forum  i understand the full ramifications of  that and i am prepared to do so  i dont believe that you can make the  same claim  obviously not as i am an atheist  i dont think youd get on with jesus though he was a longhaired lunatic peacenik was he not   and btw the reason i brought up the blanketbombing in germany was  because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being   so deplorable  yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing  wasnt accurate enough to hit industrialmilitary targets in a  decisive way by any other method at that time  but in the gulf war  precision bombing was the norm  so the point was why make a big  stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted  in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians  proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing  in ww2  right  unfortunately for you it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that i condemned the bombing of dresden too  i think youre being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy too  you make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door  as i understand it that is not the case we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the german people   civilians suffer  but less civilians suffered in this war than  any other iany other in history  oh come on  with wars like the falklands fresh in peoples minds that sort of propaganda isnt going to fool anyone                                                         the stories  of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk  yes bunk  the us lost 230000 servicemen in ww2 over four years  and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting  yes  and what about the millions of casualties the russians suffered  its hardly surprising the us didnt lose many men in ww2 given that you turned up late   mathew ,0

some more tests     first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic the movie i had been using only had 18 frames in it it was a    version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor    i decided something a little longer would give closer to realworld results    for better or for worse     i pulled out a copy of 2001 a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv    a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie theres a sequence where    the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized    a portion of about 30 seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space    station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only    5 frames per second to give a total of 171 frames     i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384288 pixels with the spigot    card in my centris 650 quartersize resolution from a pal source i then    imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor    keeping the 5 fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled    to 320240 resolution the other at 160120 resolution i used the default    200 quality setting in premiere 201 and specified a key frame every ten    frames     i then ran the 320240 movie through the same raw speed test program i used    for the results id been reporting earlier     result a playback rate of over 45 frames per second     thats right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie just for fun i copied the 320240 movie to my external hard    disk a quantum lp105s and ran it from there this time the playback rate    was only about 35 frames per second obviously the 230mb internal hard disk    also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback     i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors and tried playing back the 160120 movie scaled to 320240    size this time the playback speed was over 60 fps clearly the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 10 in    action not 15 id try my tests with quicktime 10 but i dont think its    entirely compatible with my centris and system 71     unscaled the playback rate for the 160120 movie was over 100 fps     the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 320240 movie with    preferred playback rates greater than 10 and seeing how well they played    from within movieplayer ie with quicktimes normal synchronized playback    a preferred rate of 90  45 fps didnt work too well the playback was    very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved 45 fps with    ease i cant believe that quicktimes synchronization code would add this    much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac systems task    switching     a preferred rate of 70  35 fps seemed to work fine i couldnt see    any evidence of stutter at 80  40 fps i think i could see slight    stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell     i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also    improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance    even more

zealand    37 47 26 s 175 19 7 e gmt1200   im afraid i missed the start of this thread but there are three factors that can significantly affect quicktimes playback speed that you may want to take into account  1 playback bit depth things are fastest when you play a movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for this is usually 8 or 16 bit but other depths are of course possible  2 type of scaling qt is optimized for double size scaling other scaling factors hit peformance much harder  3 playback window position movieplayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default im not sure about premiere  any combination of those can radically alter playback performance  image size is of course another biggie  giving the movie player lots of ram can also make a real difference  forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread  peter lee      peter e lee software conductor                         specular international inc

326,490,from pharveyquackkfucom paul harvey subject daniel v zoroaster was the jewish discomfort with jesus organization the duck pond public unix 1 408 249 9630 log in as guest lines 281  in article 17462bd37a66paranetfidonetorg  billcarlsonp0f18n104z1fidonetorg bill carlson writes  since everywhere i look zoroaster is suggested as being a probable  descendant of daniel suppose you prove he wasnt  zoroaster is far older than daniel if anything one could claim that in a sense daniel is a descendant of zoroaster as daniel though being hebrew has assimilated into zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the tanakh of judaism however the majority  of the book is in hellenistic aramaic not babylonian aramaic and only has kethuvim or writing status  ref encyclopedia of religion mircea eliade  daniel or in hebrew daniyyel hero of the biblical book that bears his name daniel is presented as a jew in the babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lions pit he also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of israels restoration to nationalreligious autonomy as a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court described in daniel 16 written in the third person daniel per forms his interpretations alone while as a visionaryapocalyptist in daniel 712 written in the first person he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future it is likely that the name daniel is pseudonymous a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition ez 144283   the authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language daniel 1124a and 812 are written in hebrew whereas daniel 24b728 is in aramaic the language division parallels the subject division daniel 16 concerns legends and dream interpretations 712 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies the overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances daniel 27 is chiliastically related suggest an attempt at redactional unity after the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion a chronological ordering is discernable a sequence from king nebuchadrezzar to darius is reported dn 712 much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic for example daniel 4 speaks of nebuchadrezzars transformation into a beast a story that is reported in the qumran scrolls of nabonidus belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of babylon although he was never king and darius is called a mede who conquered babylon and is placed before cyrus ii of persia although no such darius is known the medes followed the persians and darius is the name of several persian kings presumably the episodes of daniel 26 depicting a series of monarchical reversals episodes of ritual observances and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the seleucid period late fourth to midsecond century bce in order to reinvigorate waning jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith   the visions of daniel 712 reporting events from the reign of belshazzar to that of cyrus ii but actually predicting the overthrow of seleucid rule in palestine were collected and published during the reign of antiochus iv prior to the maccabean revolt for it was then beginning in 168 bce that the jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to judaism and their ancestral traditions and many refused to desecrate the statues of moses and endured a martyrs death for their resolute trust in divine dominion all of the visions of daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways for example via images of the enthronement of a god of judgment with a son of man invested with rule this figure was interpreted by jews as michael the archangel and by christians as christ in chapter 7 via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations as in chapter 8 or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies especially those of jeremiah 25911 as found in daniel 912   the imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter 2 representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin is one of the enduring images of the book it sur vived as a prototype of jewish and christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the middle ages the role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete isaac abravanel the scientist isaac newton and the philosopher jean bodin and among the fifth monarchy men of seventeenth century england for example is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups the schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent   the encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in daniel 1112 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of isaiah 52135312 regarding the suffering servant of god not as all israel but as the select faithful neither the opening stories about daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt they rather advocate a stance of piety civil disobedience and trustful resignation victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel michael and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the maccabean fighters and may reflect some protopharisaic group of hasidim or pietists the themes of resistance to oppression freedom of worship preservation of monotheistic integrity the overthrow of historical dominions and the acknowledgement of the god of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour  zarathushtra founder of the religion know as zoroastrianism or mazdaism from mazda or ahura mazda the name of the god prophesied by zarathushtra the etymology and history of zarathushtra the avestan and oldest form of the name as uncertain both in various iranian languages and in related forms else where there may have been an old persian form zaraushtra from which the greek form zoroastres may be derived and there may have existed an old iranian form zaratushtra to which may be linked the middle iranian zrdrwsht several middle persian forms such as zrtwsht and the new persian zardusht we can state with certainty only that the second half of the name ushtra means camel the form zoroaster derived from the greek zoroastres was used traditionally in european culture until the eighteenth century when zarathustra closer to the original and as found in nietzsche came into common use after the rediscovery of the avesta the collection of sacred books of zoroastrianism and the resulting studies in iranian philology see avesta   notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of zarathushtra even in western culture the sources available to us are few extremely fragmented and heterogeneous our principle sources are the five gathas songs attributed to zarathushtra himself and included in the yasna section of the avesta gatha ahunavaiti yasna 2834 gatha ushtavaiti yasna 4346 gatha spentamainyu yasna 4750 gatha vokukhshathra yasna 51 and gatha vashishtoishti yasna 53 the last of which was probably written after the prophets death   other sources of considerable albeit varying importance are the younger avesta and the remaining zoroastrian religious literature in particular the pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures ce although the achaemenid inscriptions sixth to fourth centures bce never mention zarathushtra he is mentioned by some greek sources of the time not however by herodotus who seems unaware of him   the avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of zarathushtra but the text is useful in an indirect way as it clearly implies that the environment in which zoroastrianism arose was not that of iran under the medes or the persians the greek sources on the other hand do provide some information concerning the time of zarathushtra although from a historical point of view they are unreliable some place him six thousand years before the trojan war xanthus of lydia eudoxus of cnidus hermippus hermodorus aristotle plutarch diogenes laertius and pliny the account by xanthus of lydia however has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred rather than six thousand years before the expedition of xerxes against greece this interpretation is favored by diogenes laertius who makes reference to xanthus but although a few scholars a s shabazi helmut humbach have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts it is generally rejected   although the historical value of the greek sources is negligible they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in iran by the achaemenid period as the above account would seem to demonstrate they also show that by this time zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure one from an extremely distant past all of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with or even close to that of the achaemenids   later zoroastrian sources the pahlavi texts do provide an absolute chrono logy for zarathushtra one that was also accepted by some arab authors accord ing to these sources zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before alexander again scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification the most convincing arguments however seem to support the latter position the figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface because it represents in fact the more general one of 300 which was employed by sasanid propagandists to locate zarathushtras lifetime roughly around the beginning of iranian domination for a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the iranian chronology there was also a desire on the part of the sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat in this context zarathushtra whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos converted vishtaspa at the age of fortytwo and vishtaspas conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before alexander   given the unreliability of the few available sources we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements principally on the contention that zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before cyrus the great cambyses and darius as there is no mention in the avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western iran in the middle of the first millennium bce nor is there any mention of the history of that period which was to lead iran to a position of such predominance at the same time for a number of reasons going back much further in history would not be justified consequently the traditionally accepted theory of placing zara thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium bce appears to be the most legitimate   as to zarathushtras land of origin many scholars agree on the basis of valid arguments that he must have come from eastern iran some have held that he was a mede largely because of a late iranian tradition linking zarathushtra with azerbaijan but also because of linguistic reasons based on the language of the avesta this hypothesis however should be discarded as we can suppose both on historical and linguistic grounds that zarathushtra came from the east even though we do not know precisely from which region there is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter including the improbable view that he came from chorasmia or presentday khorezm or from a wider chorasmian region reaching as far as the oases of merv and herat most likely however zarathushtras land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the hindu kush mountain range to the more southern regions of bactria and arachosia modern qandahar as well as drangiana the area of lake helmand it would thus be located in what is now afghanistan or in the border regions of iran   zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste yasna 336 he was a zaotar cf sanskrit hotr that is a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry even in the socalled younger avesta he is described as an athravan yashts 1394 a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste to enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training which he used to lend dignity as in the gathas to the contents of his new message the product of a great and original ethical mind   zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition linking india to iran in another way by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan or possessor of asha that is the one who as in the vedic rtavan seeks truth and masters it thus becoming ashavan in this life  almost an initiate  and blessed after death any good follower of such teachings seeks the vision of asha just as those chosing the right path in vedic india aspired to the vision of the sun a manifestation of rta behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of aryan mysticism that is of indoiranian mysticism   zarathushtras greatness however does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition rather it lies in the innovation and strength of his message which was in itself a break in the tradition one that force fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas dualistic monotheism the wise lord who fathers two twin spirits the beneficent and the evil and the expectation of a transfiguration av frashokereti pahl frashgird of life and existence see frashokereti    both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate zarathushtras teachings from the indoiranian tradi tions of his upbringing they exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil because of his basic tenets zarathushtra who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi tion can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures   another original facet of zarathushtras message one that is not easy to understand but which however holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the gathas is the doctrine of the amesha spentas the beneficent immortals these are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought best truth desirable power bounteous devotion wholeness and immortality all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue see amesha spentas   other than the names of his father pourushaspa possessing gray horses and of his mother dughdova one who has milked we know almost nothing of zarathushtras life a late pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers according to tradition zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty and at thirty he was subject to a revelation both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision only after ten years had passed however did he succeed in converting a cousin of his maidhyoimah to his beliefs he was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis karapans and usijs priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices this hostility caused him to leave his region yasna 461 and to seek refuge at the court of kavi vishtaspa a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife hutaosa when the prophet according to tradition was fortytwo years old we also know the name of a son isat vastra desiring pastures and of three daughters born of his first wife as well as the names of two more sons urvatatnara commanding men and hvarecithra sunfaced born of his second wife hvovi a member of the influential hvogva possessing good cattle family two other figures belonging to the hvogva family are mentioned frashaoshtra and jamaspa the former as hvovis father and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet pouruchista very thoughtful whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the gathas yasna 53 again according to tradition zarathushtra died at the age of seventyseven he was assassinated by a karapan a priest of the old religion who belonged to the tuirya tribe and was called tur i bradres his name is known only in the pahlavi form   the paucity of information on the prophets life is compensated by a tradi tion rich in legendary detail that arose through the centuries in zoroastrian communities the main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the denkard a pahlavi work dating from the ninth century ce as well as passages from other pahlavi texts and a new persian work from the thirteenth century the zarathushtnama book of zarathushtra written by zaratushti bahrami pazhdu mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about zarathushtra which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man   zarathushtras great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the renaissance until the enlightenment during the classical and hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man a typical representative of an alien wisdom a master of the secrets of heaven and earth a seer astrologer psychologist and wonder worker pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of zarathushtra on pythagoras himself and the academicians always openly admired the persian thinker who founded the school of the magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism earliest christianity viewed zarathushtra as a precursor of the christian faith one who not only prophesied as had the biblical prophets the advent of the messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming the star that was to appear in the east and guide the three magi to the manger in bethlehem see magi this christian interpretation is derived from the zoroastrian doctrine of the saoshyant the savior of the future see saoshyant later however religious struggles arose during the sasanid empire in persia third to seventh centuries ce which linked the spread of christianity with the roman empire zarathushtras popularity in the christian world began to decline the iranian prophet who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by mani as one of the three great messengers from the past was now seen instead as a leader of imposture and heresy a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery but during the renaiss ance and the enlightenment european cultures reverted to the image of zara thushtra that had come down through classical and hellenistic antiquity he was viewed once again as a great and wise man as the author of the chaldean oracles and probably inventor of qabbalah as a teacher of astrology as a possible bridge between christianity and platonism and at times as in voltaire as a symbol of nonchristian wisdom   after western philology rediscovered zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries friedrich nietzsche in an intentional paradox gave the name zarathustra to the hero of his work also sprach zarathustra 1883 1892 nietzsche saw the iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things that is the eternal struggle between good and evil see also zoroastrianism ,3

331,1206,from einkaufaustinibmcom mark einkauf subject re need help zbuffering lines  areas together originator markeinkaufaustinibmcom organization ibm austin keywords zbuffer roundoff lines areas lines 105     david gorgen writes   im asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low  apparent precision in zbuffering that ive encountered in 2 different  pex implementations  i cant find any discussion of this problem in any  resources i can lay hands on eg the compwindowsxpex faq gaskinss  pexlibprogrammingmanual vendors documentation      the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching  artifacts resulting from the use of zbuffering with polylines that are  coplanar with filled areas  the interpolated z values along a line will  differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values  across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with  vertices of the area  because of this its a tossup whether the  zbuffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed  visually the result tends to be a dashedline effect even though the  line is supposed to be solid   using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly  different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one  for the areas and one for the lines  the pex structures or immediate  mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in  effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines  the  result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to  attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines   this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used  in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards ie  smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view  table entry used for areas  this means that when a point is transformed  to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than  if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias   i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount  to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the zbuffer  typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 ie 16 or 24 bit zbuffers  therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc  between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix  the stitching   but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0003  to 0006 of the range  empirically its worst when the npc z  component of the slope of the surface is high ie when it appears more  or less edgeon to the viewer  its as if only 8 or 9 bits of the  zbuffer have any dependable meaning  this amount is so great that one  problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through  areas which they are supposed to lie behind   ive observed the problem on both hewlettpackard and digital  workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree  the test  program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 5x implementation  this version is known to compile and run on an hpux system with pex  51   open questions      1 why does this happen            am i configuring the pex view table wrongly            is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines              as opposed to areas eg pixel centers versus corners which              could be corrected for            are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their              interpolators            something else      2 what to do about it            can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision              in zbuffered hlhsr            is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching              artifacts            am i just out of luck   we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstations  i was also shocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits assuming 24 bit z buffer  this seems huge but is only 1256 of the dynamic range  in those terms it doesnt seem so bad  what is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear due mainly to roundoff i believe  so the polygon is not planar in z but is more like a ruffles potato chip  ditto with lines  when you startend at different xy values the ridges are out of phase resulting in the stitch effect  you have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another but with different vertices  you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap   example   try polygon 1 100100100 100200100 200200100 200100100       polygon 2 125125100 125175100 175175100 175125100  your implementation is correct  in fact we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons  such as nurbs surfaces with isoparametric lines  without the trick the lines appear stitched as you say  when the application draws linespolygons independently the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting so the application must do it  this is what you have discovered and are doing bravo  note to ibmers  the information given here has been

correct email address to reply to      1  what is jpeg  jpeg pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 1bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   2  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 24bitperpixel color data instead of 8bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 2 mbyte fullcolor file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 24 bitspixel 16 million colors instead of 8 or less 256 or fewer colors  if you have only 8bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 8bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 7 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   3  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 24bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 7 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 256 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 14 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   4  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 727x525 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 6b  file9   size in bytes99comments  shipppm91145040  original file in ppm format no compression 24 bits 999 or 3 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead shipppmz9 963829  ppm file passed through unix compress 999 compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note 999 other textoriented compressors give similar results shipgif9 240438  converted to gif with ppmquant fs 256  ppmtogif 999 most of the savings is the result of losing color 999 info gif saves 8 bitspixel not 24  see sec 7  shipjpg959 155622  cjpeg q 95    highest useful quality setting 999 this is indistinguishable from the 24bit original 999 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs shipjpg759  58009  cjpeg q 75    default setting 999 you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 999 from the original even with both onscreen at once shipjpg509  38406  cjpeg q 50 999 this has slight defects if you know what to look 999 for you could tell its been jpeged without seeing 999 the original  still as good image quality as many 999 recent postings in usenet pictures groups shipjpg259  25192  cjpeg q 25 999 jpegs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent 999 at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some 999 still ive seen plenty of usenet postings that were 999 of poorer image quality than this shipjpg5o9   6587  cjpeg q 5 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead 999 blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 999 indexing purposes  note that this file is tiny 999 the compression ratio from the original is 1731   in this case jpeg can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 75 file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   5  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 95 does not mean keep 95 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 75 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 75 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 95 saying q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 95 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 50 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 75 is about right for compressing 24bit images but q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting gifs see section 14 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right  q 2 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   6  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   6a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  xv shareware 25 is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats  it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu 1824012 file contribxv300tarz  version 300 is a major upgrade with support for 24bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking  if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 221 also available from export  note that version 221 is not a good choice if you have a 24bit display youll get only 8bit color nor for converting 24bit images to jpeg  but 221 works fine for converting gif and other 8bit images to jpeg  caution there is a glitch in version 221 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 24bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 303  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage303tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 303 is using a hackedover v1  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli114tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 24bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os2 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 25 is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 129975050 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg25zip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386486 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 12 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv12zip  hiview requires a 386 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm386 and 386max work windows and os2 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 30  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 21 available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview21zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv2zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 860a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 25  available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw860azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic50 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg4zip or jpeg4386zip if you have a 386 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 6b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif2jpgjpg2gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 24bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 20 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif2jpg2zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy  this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats  it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 162 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsalch162zip  note about simtel20 the internets key archive site for pcrelated programs is simtel20 full name wsmrsimtel20armymil 1928811020  simtel20 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel20 that really means pd1msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel20 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 14121010117 which keeps simtel20 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel20 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 10 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 31 and 256ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version

the current version is 21 available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows3winjp210zip  this is a slow 286compatible version if you register youll get the 386only version which is roughly 25 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 30  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 097 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin3desktopcview097zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors

the above programs  strong 24bit display support  shareware 20  macintosh  most mac jpeg programs rely on apples jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running system 607 or later  if youre running system 6 you must also install the 32bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 7  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 1192 this file contains quicktime 15 which is better than qt 10 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 15  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 10 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 20 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 364406 file infomacappjpegview20hqx  requires system 7 and quicktime  on 8bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 40 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 232  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter232hqx  requires system 605 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert10hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v06 a jpeggif converter based on an old version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt10stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 7 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 32bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress201hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 32bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 201 or later can read and write

group is a volunteer organization if youd like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join   7  whats all this hoopla about color quantization  most people dont have fullcolor 24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 8bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 256orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 256 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 256color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 256 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 256color gif on a 16color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan8bit display hardware already 15bit hicolor pc displays true 24bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   8  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart13  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   9  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 100 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v4 free jpeg code you can also say sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 6 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   10  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 60 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 60 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 6a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 11 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif2jpgjpg2gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   11  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  1  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d8 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 10 followed by jfif  2  if you see ff d8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  3  hsi files start with hsi1  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  4  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it  5  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d8     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  9begin line 9mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  9begin line 9mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   12  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   13  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    14  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 3 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 12 or 13rd the size of the gif file not 14th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 75 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v4 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 10 or so when converting gifs values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 85 smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg group at jpeginfouunetuunet    999tom lane 999organizer

shell know what to do       but if heshe did you would probably consider it rape    probably because it is rape      simple logic arguments are folly  if you read the bible you will see   that jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic   our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  yet some think it is   the ultimate  if you rely simply on your reason then you will never   know more than you do now     your argument is of the type youll know once you try  yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried and believed  for many years but were eventually honest enough to admit that   they had lived in a virtual reality      obviously there are many christians who have tried and do believe so    so nothing  it may work for some but not for others it doesnt give any insight into an overall god or overall truth of a religion it would seem to be dependent solely on the individual as well as individuallycreated  and since christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better than ours i do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary or even particularly attractive      to learn you must accept that which you dont know    what does this mean to learn you must accept that you dont know   something righto but to learn you must accept something i dont  know why this is not the way i prefer to learn it is unwise to  merely swallow everything you read suppose i write a book telling  how the great invisible pink unicorn tm has helped me in my  daily problems would you accept this since you cant know whether  it is true or not      no one asks you to swallow everything in fact jesus warns against it   but let  me ask you a question  do you beleive what you learn in history class or for  that matter anything in school  i mean its just what other people have told  you and you dont want to swallow what others say right    well we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not but at the very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that say there was a military conflict in vietnam 25 years ago then there is a supernatural diety who wants us to live a certain way  the fact that jesus warned against it means nothing  i warn against it too  big deal     the life  death and resurection of christ is documented historical fact    this is not true  the first two choices here life and death are scantily documented and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the bible and that is totally circular  perhaps it be better to use the imagination or ones ignorance  someone else will address this im sure and refer you to plenty of documentation  as much  as anything else you learn  how do you choose what to believe and what not to  i could argue that george washington is a myth  he never lived because i dont  have any proof except what i am told   however all the major events of the life  of jesus christ were fortold hundreds of years before him  neat trick uh  how is this  there is nothing more disgusting than christian attempts to manipulateinterpret the old testament as being filled with signs for the coming of christ  every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is autmoatically interpreted as the cross  what a miscarriage of philology     there is no way to get into a sceptical heart  you can not say you have given a   sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have  you must trust not just go   to church and participate in its activities  were you ever willing to die for what  you believed    well since we have skeptical hearts thank goodness there is no way to get into us  here we have the irreconcilable difference christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub trustbelieffaith without knowledge  if i am lucky one day and i happen to be thinking of god at the same time my enkephalins go up then i may associate this as a sign of god it will feel right and i will trust without knowing  maybe  religosity does not seem to be anything that is conclusively arrived at but rather it seems to be more of a sudden affliction i believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed many of us were not  the question is is suchg an attitude reflective of a correct or healthy morality  it would seem not to be  the same thing could reflect fanaticism for example and is any case an expression of simple selfishness    adam    adam

kaxcsnottacuk wrote  about my reply   diplomatic   it a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming usenet diplomacy is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through isnt it   i realize im fighting occams razor in this argument so ill try to  explain why i feel a mind is necessary   kevin unfortunately you are now delving into field i know too little about algorithms your reasoning as i see it is very much along the lines of roger penrose who claimed that mathematical insight cannot be algorithmic in his book the emperors new mind concerning computers minds and the laws of physics however penroses claim that he has mathematical insight or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look could be just illusions  we are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints  i try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective realising that it might not be anything special but certainly useful thinking back of what i wrote do you think worms have minds or not they are able to experience pain at least they behave  just like that yet it is conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a total synthesis of c elegans from the elements would such a worm have a mind   firstly im not impressed with the ability of algorithms theyre  great at solving problems once the method has been worked out but not  at working out the method itself  this is true to some extent however i do not think that our brains work like computers at all in fact there is substantial evidence skarda 1985 skarda  freeman 1987 that brains work more or less chaotically generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators i suppose   the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered does  this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already  preprogrammed into our brains this is somewhat unlikely given that  our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic  material much of which isnt used  indeed this is extremely unlikely given the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain i suggest however that before trying to understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms   kevin take a look at the references i mentioned and think again i still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind are neurologists neuropsychologists and biologists but do not  flame me for my opinions since they study beings that are conscious   the reason i am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different  and please do not bring qm into this discussion at all  not all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness plays some special role in physics i would say it doesnt   the other problem with algorithms is their instability not many  algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet  people survive strokes without going completely haywire there are  sideeffects but patients still seem remarkably stable also  neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate   can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt various bits of its  code  again brains are not computers dont forget this this does not mean they need something else to work  they just work differently their primary purpose is perception and guidance of action  selfawareness and high intelligence are later appearances   the next problem is the sticky question of what is colour replace  colour with the sensation of your choice presumably the  materialist viewpoint is that its the product of some kind of  chemical reaction the usual products of such a reaction are energy   different chemicals is colour a mixture of these  you are still expecting that we could find the idea of green in our brains somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical this is not how i see it the sensation green is a certain timedependent pattern in the area v4 of our visual cortex and it is distributed with the help of areas v1 and v2 to the rest of the brain   indeed a firing pattern i have sometimes thought of our consciousness as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns but this is just idle speculation  scientific americans september 1992 issue was a special issue on mind and brain have you already read it from cover to cover  there are two articles on visual perception so you might be  interested  but again please note that subjective experiences cannot be  observed from a thirdperson perspective if we see nothing but  neuronal activity we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the mind  kalat 1988 writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the  patients state of mind for instance a patient whose septal area was stimulated without his knowledge by remote control during a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression and started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend  stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing situations when the patients have started flirting with the therapist  in conclusion there is evidence that  1 brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences     brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage  2 conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in    various areas of brain  when we think of colours our    visual cortex is activated etc  3 consciousness is an afterthought  we become conscious of our    actions with a half a second delay and our brains are ahead    of our conscious will by at least 350 ms   thus i think it is fruitful to turn the question why do i see colours around and ask what is this i that seems to be  observing since it seems that our conscious mind is not the king of our brains   if this is so a  computer wont see colour because the chemistry is different does an  algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an  equivalent that doesnt it shouldnt because the outputs of each  algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances so why do  we see colour  this depends on what is meant by seeing colours does a neural network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 see the numbers if it is capable of sorting them  if you are asking why does an animal who is conscious of itself as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who doesnt i have a good answer  read my previous posting where i wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap roles and act more morally so that they dont unconsciously kill each other with newly discovered weapons a bit extreme but this is the basic idea  when early homo became more and more efficient in using tools  a sense of identity and the concept of self had to evolve in line with this development indeed respect for others and  conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages for social animals such as early humans    if i remember correctly quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction  with two processes acting on it the first process has been called  unitary evolution or u is governed by schroedingers equation  and is well known the second process called various things such as  collapse of the wavefunction or state vector reduction or r  and is more mysterious it is usually said to occur when a  measurement takes place although nobody seems to know precisely  when that occurs when it does occur the effect of r is to abruptly  change the wavefunction  if minds are required for this does this mean that until human minds came to the scene wavefunctions never collapsed but remained in the superpositions for aeons my how powerful we are  this has been discussed before and i think this topic is irrelevant since we do not agree that minds are necessary and neither do physicists    anyway im speculating that minds would be in part x there seems to  be some link between consciousness and r in that we never see linear  superpositions of anything although there are alternative  explainations for this ive no idea how a brain is supposed to access  part x but since this is only speculation that wont matter too  much  my main point is that there might be a place for minds in  physics  i agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above  physics needs sharp minds to solve many real problems    ill go back to my nice padded cell now if thats ok with you   its ok if you dont forget to take with you the

writes        ah that old chestnut your claim that moral objectivism  scientific objectivism i dont agree with it now try proving through some objective moral test that my disagreeing is incorrect     your claim which you have deleted now was not universal  not objective        ive deleted it now in the interest of brevity go back a step and youll see it was still in your post yes that was my claim if you can refute it then please do so  firstly an apology  you hadnt deleted your claim and i was mistaken in saying you had sorry for any offence caused  secondly  how can i refute your definition  i can only point up its logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage of the word objective in other areas  indeed by your definition an objective x is an oxymoron for all x  i have no quibble with that belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly good word   so what is objective  not the age of the universe anyway as i show  above        how many ages can the universe have and still be internally self consistent id be amazed if it was more than one how many different moral systems can different members of society have  indeed single individuals in some cases  and humanity still stick together  begging the question  people can have many opinions about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together   you are saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about it  why        the age of the universe like most scientific facts can be emirically verified through means thatll give the same result no matter who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the largish side   this assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality which doesnt depend on what we think   why should an extreme biblical creationist give a rats ass about the means of which you speak  ive heard of no way to verify morality in a consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to enlighten me  the same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted to work with some accuracy better than a random guess  i wrote elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value if a moral system makes a prediction it will be better if that can be tested and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction this drug will relieve pain        peoples ideas about the age of object x are not objective you can have any idea you like and i cant stop you universae and their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you dislike some detail of them thats a problem with your opinion of them   sure  assume an objective reality and you get statements like this  i claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such subjective and individual if im wrong then some moreorless objectively real thing exists which you label objective morality can you back up this positive claim of existence  can you back up your positive claim above  no  thats because its an assumption  i make the same assumption about values on the basis that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical basis of the two is precisely the same        point morals are in essence personal opinions usually ideally wellfounded motivated such but nonetheless personal the fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question sometimes even for the same reason does not make morals objective it makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question which can be good for the evolution of a social species    and if a real large lot nice phrase of people agree that there is a   football on a desk im supposed to see a logical difference between the two    perhaps you can explain the difference to me since you seem to see it  so clearly        take a look on the desk  ie perform a test iffootball then accept theory else do tell people theyre hallucinating        now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform me which way to look and why to look that particular way as opposed to some other get my drift  no just look  are you claiming never to know what good means        science is a whole other matter altogether    says you  prove that those who disagree are wrong        thats a simple matter of proving the track record of the scientific method  i think its great and should be applied to values  i may be completely wrong but thats what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought    frank odwyer                                  im not hatching that odwyersseie

morality and seemingly hitting semantics    secondly  how can i refute your definition  i can only point up its  logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage  of the word objective in other areas  indeed by your definition an  objective x is an oxymoron for all x  i have no quibble with that  belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly  good word        it may be that being a nonnative englishspeaker ive misunderstood your usage of objective and tried to debate something you dont assert my apologies im at a loss to imagine what you really do mean though        how many ages can the universe have and still be internally self consistent id be amazed if it was more than one how many different moral systems can different members of society have  indeed single individuals in some cases  and humanity still stick together    begging the question  people can have many opinions about the age  of the universe and humanity can still stick together   you are  saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about  it  why        wrong point the age of the universe has no direct effect on humanitys sticking power in the way the moral system of a society can have        im saying the universe has a real age because i see evidence for it cosmology astronomy and so on i say this age is independent of peoples opinions of it because i know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results        the age of the universe like most scientific facts can be emirically verified through means thatll give the same result no matter who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the largish side     this assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality  which doesnt depend on what we think        i cant see how it does that put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations see to it she makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating and the result of the test will be the same   why should an extreme biblical  creationist give a rats ass about the means of which you speak        because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion if those tests were just my opinion then their own tests which would then be their opinion would contradict mine even if we conducted said tests in identical manner no they dont which i take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them  ive heard of no way to verify morality in a consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to enlighten me    the same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted  to work with some accuracy better than a random guess        map the activity of nerves and neural activity if you mean physical pain you have a sharp point ill give you that but you still havent given me a way to quantify morality   i wrote  elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value        we agree hypotheses however can change i hold that there is no ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could gravitate but that they could be changed in any way imaginable producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes   if a moral system makes a prediction it will be better if  that can be tested        better and worse are almost always defined in the context of a moral system your prediction will always be correct within that moral system what you need now is an objective definition of good and bad i wish you luck        peoples ideas about the age of object x are not objective you can have any idea you like and i cant stop you universae and their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you dislike some detail of them thats a problem with your opinion of them     sure  assume an objective reality and you get statements like this        isnt that what youre doing when assuming an objectively real morality besides what exactly is provably wrong with my statement  i claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such subjective and individual if im wrong then some moreorless objectively real thing exists which you label objective morality can you back up this positive claim of existence    can you back up your positive claim above  no  thats because its an  assumption  i make the same assumption about values on the basis  that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical  basis of the two is precisely the same        claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim besides i think i can lend some credence to my claim ponder different individuals both fully functional as human beings and members of society but yet with wildly different moral codes if morality was objective at least one should be way off base but yet hir incorrect morality seems to function fine how come        as for producing these individuals it might be easiest to pick them from different societies say an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system for example if such still exist   deletia  testing for footballs on desks         now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform me which way to look and why to look that particular way as opposed to some other get my drift    no just look  are you claiming never to know what good means        one thing is good under some circumstances because we wish to achieve some goal for some reason other times we wish to do something else and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all        some things are hard to make good because wed seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into still the aztecs were doing fine until the spaniards wiped them out        i almost always know what good means sometimes i even know why i never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone immutable         thats a simple matter of proving the track record of the scientific method    i think its great and should be applied to values  i may be completely  wrong but thats what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of  thought        yes me too and ive tried a thing or two down that line it doesnt look good for objective values to me at all      disclaimer   its great to be young and insane ,0

my own actions not abu hanifa or imam malik etc  even if i am blindly following the opinions of abu hanifa etc    with this in mind to my understanding we must look at the reasoning  behind such opinions of muslims that support khomeinis fatwa  now to  my understanding the hadith upon which those who support khomeinis  fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war  time  now brother in general it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say  that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of  peace  i think any sensible human being can see this so i personally  think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty  for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace  regarding this particular subject    if you think i am wrong please feel free to say so with your  reasoning from quran and hadith please  not because somebody said  so i want the reasoning from alquran and the sahih hadiths    perhaps we should take our discussion to socreligionislam  please  email me rashid if you think we should do this     by the way i also disagree with your opinion regarding the punishment  for apostasy  the viewpoint i follow  that there is in general no  punishment for apostasy  is very strongly supported by quran and  hadith  this is very well shown in the book punishment in islamic law  by mohamed s elawa american trust publications 1981    i reiterate that i would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the quran in islamic history as well apostasy has rarely been punished  belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will  however when an apostate makes attacks upon god and his messenger the situation changes now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges  perhaps  charges of sedition treason spying etc if the person  makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks as opposed to arguement against islam the situation is likewise complicated if the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods again the situation changes the punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in anyhow the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in rushdies case  there is a distinction in the quran between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war by their actions creates disorder makes mischiefetc  against the muslims and creates a situation that results in harm  to muslims here a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise in other words there is a clear difference between a formal war situation where two clearly defined parties wage war conclude treaties exchange prisoners etc and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against islam it is the second situation  the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that  would apply in the case of rushdie  the matter of rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an  offensive book banning the book is secondary  a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well including the deaths of many muslims and rushdies and his publishers media games    now i do not believe in blindly following anyone no matter  how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law  if someone tells me  islam says such and such i immediately say show me the support for  this statement from the quran and sunnah  i believe this to be my  islamic duty for according to one hadith of the prophet peace and  blessings of god be with him if your leader tells you to enter a fire  and you do it and kill yourself then you have sinned for doing   wrong even though you  were blindly following the instructions of your leader  i am  responsible for

peace  i think any sensible human being can see this so i personally  think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty  for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace  regarding this particular subject  i am not sure which hadith you are referring to above i believe that one of the quranic verses on which the fatwa is based is 533 every verse in the quran has a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way is the understanding the tafsir of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed if this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the muslims were not involved in conflict should be suspended when they were at war the logic does not follow in complex reallife situations there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single complicated situation the internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task it is not necessarily a simple this or that process there may be many parameters involved there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed all these matters impinge on the situation  in other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the quran the quran asks us to reflect on its verses but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith if the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that however if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the state to the gestation of laws and rulings to the gestation of society the dispensing of justice the guidance of the community then there  are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one  should achieve jaffar ibn muhammad assadiqas relates some of  these requirements as taught by the prophetsa in a hadith  he who does not distinguish in the book of allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguous and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and does not recognize a verse of meccan period from a medinite one and does not know the circumstances  of revelation and does not understand the technical words of the quran whether simple or compound and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and is ignorant of advancing and delaying in its verses and does not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the beginning from the termination and is unaware of the question and the answer the disjoining and the joining and the exceptions and the allinclusive and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one the obligatory laws and the permissions the places of the duties and rules and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful and does not know the joined words and the words that are related to those coming before them or after them  then such a man does not know the quran nor is he among the people of the quran  based on these and other hadiths and in accordance with many quranic verses why should not a company from every group remain behind  to gain profound understanding tafaqquh in religion and to warn  people when they return to them so that they may beware 9122 a science of jurisprudence arose the requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion are many ive listed a few major  divisions below  there are of course many subdivisions within these headings   knowledge of arabic syntax conjugation roots semantics oratory  knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir  logic mantiq  a knowledge of hadiths  a knowledge of transmitters rijal  knowledge of the principles of juriprudence quran sunnah consensus reasoning  the study of quran and sunnah for purposes of law involves  discussion of imperatives awamir  discussion of negative imperatives nawahi  discussion of generalities and particularities aam wa khas  discussion of unconditional and conditional  discussion of tacit meanings  discussion of the abstract and the clear  discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated  the principles of application of the law involves  principles of exemption  principles of precaution  principles of option  principles of mastery  the jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation it is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith   now no one should blindly follow anyone but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself there is the famous hadith of the prophet sa in which he says the fuqaha religious scholars are the trustees of the prophet as  long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires pleasures and wealth of this world the prophet sa was asked o messenger of god how may we know if they so concern themselves he sa replied by seeing whether they follow the ruling power if they do that fear for your religion and shun them i do not yet know enough about the imams of the four sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them  the prophet also refered to the fuqaha as the fortress of islam my only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise  the specifics of this expertise is  delineated in the quran and hadith those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the quran and hadith  those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society state and religion  are cautioned  the only reason i said anything at all about the rushdie affair in this group is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa that is apostasy was wrong when one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact secondly khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible  another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him   perhaps we should take our discussion to socreligionislam  please  email me rashid if you think we should do this  i agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup unfortunately i do not have any access to email so private discussion or a moderated group is out of the question i cannot post to a moderated group like socreligionislam how about socculturearabic or talkreligionmisc  as salaam alaikum ,0

509,1127,from mathew mathewmantiscouk subject moral relativism  what if we all agree was re after 2000 etc organization mantis consultants cambridge uk xnewsreader rusnews v102 lines 111  frankd012s658uucp frank odwyer writes  in article 9304221138077q9rusnewsw165wmantiscouk mathew   mathewmantiscouk writes  got it in one  similarly a moral relativist will not judge one moral syste  to be better than another in every possible circumstance  this does not  however preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than anothe  in a specific set of circumstances  nor does it preclude a set of moral  relativists from collectively judging a moral system from some set of  circumstances which they all agree they are in    ok this makes sense to me  im serious youve explained something  to me which i never understood before  but just for grins suppose we  almost all agree that we are in a set of circumstances called reality  what then  then we all live happily ever after   seriously if we all agreed on the circumstances were in i suspect wed all agree on the best course of action  unfortunately i have no confidence that such a situation will ever arise   some of us think theres a big god in the sky some dont  some think theyve been chosen by god others disagree  some think they are infallible others think otherwise  until those disagreements over circumstances can be ironed out theres little hope of everyone agreeing       or say for all practical intents and purposes there is no frame  of reference in which thus and such is good isnt that approximately  objective in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to  outrun a snail  yes  i think that for example only a vanishingly small number of people would hold that theres a frame of reference in which gassing six million jews is good  so thats probably about as close to an objective moral value as ive encountered in my life so far                         for example if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area  isnt it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act even  though there conceivably might be some tailend case that would justify it  well i think your examples poor  if the bombs in iraq for example and was dropped by an american plane many people would hold that it was a moral act     and what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if    it isnt an objective reality for values      im sorry i cant parse an objective reality for values  could you tr  y   again      san objective reality for valuessome values are real even in the face   of disagreement    i still dont quite see what youre trying to say  i assume by values you  mean moral values yes  in which case what do you mean by real  what is  a real moral value as opposed to an unreal one    i mean to say that values are as real as horses whatever you understand  by a horse being real is pretty much what i mean about a value being real  hmm  so these moral values have a perceptible physical presence    if you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in   your opinion then all you get is infinite regress    sorry but in what way is it an infinite regress  it looks extremely finite  to me    i meant that its never more than your opinion  right and the chain ends right there  the buck stops with me  its not an infinite regress                                                         youve clarified this  for me above  my understanding is now that if a supermajority of relativists  agree that thus and such is wrong in almost any or all frames of reference  then theyre saying something which is to all practical intents and purposes  no different than what im saying  right  the key point however is that there are vanishingly few of these moral issues where we can get 999 of people to agree on the outcome for all frames of reference and agree on the frames of reference                                                       what you do not get   is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist   is inferior to that of the man of peace    sorry but thats not so  i can provide a justification for asserting that  the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace    i just cant provide a justification which works in all possible  circumstances    logically possible or actually possible  i cant manage either  killing hitler using a car bomb would have been a terrorist act but i have to admit that i couldnt exactly condemn it  although there are tricky philosophical issues to do with hindsight                                                by which i mean are you  stretching possible to include events such as the atoms in my terminal  switching places so that the terminal turns upside down or do you  think it likely that circumstances will arise in which terrorism is  superior to peace  i think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have been better than peace  better in terms of numbers of innocent people killed  assuming it was successful terrorism of course   mathew ,3

bighearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm  lets  suppose that this is a true dichotomy so papb1 trouble is alterius   is in a different universe so that no observations of alterius are possible  except for the banks  you couldnt possibly afford it     now lets examine the case for a  there is no evidence whatsoever that  there is any such thing as a bighearted alterian benefactor however  pexistsbh a b  pnotexistsbh a b  1 on the grounds that   lackofevidencefor is evidenceagainst when we have a partition like  that we dismiss hypothesis a   turning therefore to b we also find no evidence to support that  hypothesis  on the same grounds as before we dismiss hypothesis b   the problem with this is that we have dismissed all of the possible  hypotheses and even though we know by construction that the money   arrives every month we have proven that it cant because we  have dismissed all of its potential causes   thats an extremely poor argument and heres why   premise 1 this money is being paid to you by either a your big              hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm    thus each monthly appearance of the bucks should it happen is an  observation on alterius and by construction is evidence for the  existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the atm    premise 2 no observations on alterius are possible        except for the banks  you couldnt possibly afford it    you forgot to include this  my premise is actually   premise 2  the cardinality of the set of possible observations on alterius              is one   this is clearly contradictory to the first   not if you state it properly   trouble is on the basis of premise 2 you say that there can be no evidence  of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premise leads to the  conclusion that the appearance of the bucks should it happen is evidence  for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug    voila a screaming contradiction  with my highlights  sc  but in a strawman argument there is only evidence for oneofbenefactorbug  no observation to distinguish benefactor from bug is possible that is    not evidence for bug and neither is it evidence for benefactor nor    is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as  if there were no benefactorbug two statements both would be false  this is still contradictory it reduces to    1 alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug    2 this is not evidence for benefactor neither is it evidence for        bug meaning that it doesnt lend more weight to one than to the        other    3 therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence        can exist for bug  but 3 relies on a shift in meaning from 2 when you say paraphrased in 2 that this is not evidence for benefactor for example what you mean is that its no more evidence for benefactor than it is for bug  yes thats what i mean  in 3 however youve shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor so that it now means absolute evidence for benefactor rather than relative evidence for benefactor wrt bug  not really i meant evidence that would tend to one over the other  i think this is just a communications problem   what i am trying to say in my clumsy way is that while i buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions prayer your rapture example i dont buy your use of occams razor in all cases where a0  in my example one couldnt dismiss benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity  one of these is necessary to explain the dosh  i brought up the onebyone dismissal process to show that it would be wrong to do so  from what youre saying in this post it seems you agree and were talking at crosspurposes  3 is still in contradiction to 1  some sums may help with b  benefactor b  bug d  dosh arrives in account    1 implies  pbb  d  1  assuming that pbb  d  0 so its either the benefactor or a bug which is responsible if the bucks arrive but not both then     pbb  d      pb  d  pb  d  so     pb  d  pb  d    1  but 3 implies that     pb  d    0  and  pb  d    0  no this isnt what i meant  pb  d  05 and pb  d  05 with necessarily no new observation weve already seen the dosh to change those estimates  i was trying to say again in my clumsy way that it would be wrong to assign 0 probability to either of these  and thats precisely what use of the razor does in the case of gods  gods are one class of hypothesis there are many others belonging to a set of hypotheses oneofwhich is necessary to explain something which otherwise  would not be satisfactorily explained  it can be thrown out or retained on grounds of nonrational preference not of science or statistics    alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the grounds that the answer cant be known or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless being equal agnosticismweak atheism   as they do when the set m is filled by the universe is caused by x  where x is gods pink unicorns nothing etc   and no observation  tends to one conclusion over the other  exactly the point i was making i think so we dont throw out any of these contrary to your assertion above that we do  some people do simon and they think they are doing excellent science my sole point was that they arent   only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis hi ie x  where px  hi  0 can cause phi to go to zero after a finite  number of observations only in this case do we get to throw any of the  hypotheses out   exactly my point though i may have been unclear  you said the diametric opposite which i guess is the source of my confusion  i was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so   what im trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of  evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this does not hold true for  all or perhaps any versions of theism  and it isnt true that those for  which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor  on the contrary those for which it does not hold are exactly those which can be discarded using the razor see my post on the other branch of this thread  then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of  if the razor holds for gods then it holds for all like hypotheses  which means that youre assigning px  hi 0 for all i though weve already established that its not correct to do so when sumpxhi1 over all i   simply put anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or  nonexistence of gods whether inductive or no is at best mistaken and  at worst barking mad  luckily i make no such claim and have specifically said as much on numerous occasions you wouldnt be constructing a strawman here would you frank although that doesnt of course rule out my being barking mad in any case i could be barking mad in my spare time with apologies to cleese et al  but i think you miss the point once again when i say that something is evidence against an hypothesis that doesnt imply that observation of the said something necessarily falsifies the hypothesis reducing the estimate of ph  data to zero if it reduces this quantity its still evidence against h  no i got that  im talking about the case when a0  youre clearly correct when a0   and im not constructing a strawman though its certainly possible that ive misunderstood what youre saying  however by any standards a system that says when a0 gods are highly unlikely and when a0 gods can be dismissed using the razor is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either dont exist or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena  in my experience systems such as this including those which purport to prove that gods exist always contain a fallacy upon

invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered   bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor  thats your claim now

belief not belief in gods  gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators  and the really dangerous people  the sources of fanaticism  are often none of these things  they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing   thats a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say  if you believe that youre incredibly naive  now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you  to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument  and it reads to me like a warmup for censorship and restriction of religious freedom  ever read animal farm  thats a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism  no some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some fanaticism    your last statement simply isnt implied by what you say before because youre trying to sneak in innate features of all theism  the word youre groping for is some  gullibility by the way is one of them  no shit sherlock  so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make  and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer  i said it reads like a warm up to that  thats because its an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice themus  split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls  2  define irrational belief  eg is it rational to believe that      reason is always useful   irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information  well there is a glaring paradox here  an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational  which is it  thats bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed  ok its oval  its still begging the question however  and though that certainly is allowed its not rational  and you claiming to be rational and all  at the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didnt hear a refutation before so were back   deal with it  you cant use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful  someone who thinks reason is crap wont buy it you see  your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular  anybody else think godel was silly  the first part of the second statement contains no information because you dont say what the beliefs are  if the beliefs are strong theism andor strong atheism then your statement is not in general true  the second part of your sentence is patently false  counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it    ive been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here   an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way  further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms   what is it you are trying to say  that at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable  for no particular reason at all  example i am not dreaming  compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational  i cant agree with this until you are specific  which theism  to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have    using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals andor the way the world works  imo any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational  that does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of intelligence  some atheists are also scientists for example  the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis  i dont understand this  can you formalise your argument   person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste  of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekitesidolatersprotestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects  peculiar definition of interesting but sure  now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak   why arent my  catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example   maybe they  dont believe in it  maybe its the conjunction of b asserts b and jailkill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant  it certainly seems so to me but then i have no axe to grind here

lifted off from the tyuratam space center in the kazakhstan      republic  aboard those boosters were a new breed of venera probe      for the planet venus           designated venera 15 and 16 the probes were meant not for landing     yet more spherical craft on the venerean surface but to radar map the     planet in detail from orbit  to accomplish this task the basic     venera design was modified in numerous areas  the central bus core     was made one meter 3937 inches longer to carry the two tons of     propellant required for braking into orbit double the fuel carried by     the venera 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier  extra solar panels     were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large     amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging  the     dishshaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger      to properly transmit this information to earth           atop the buses where landers were usually placed were installed     the 14 by 6meter 462 by 198foot 300kilogram 660pound     polyus v sidelooking radar antennae  the radar system possibly a     terrainimaging version of the nuclearpowered satellites used by      the soviets for earth ocean surveillance would be able to map venus     surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers 062 to 12 miles           the soviet probes imaging parameters were a vast improvement over     the united states pioneer venus orbiter which could reveal objects      no smaller than 75 kilometers 45 miles in diameter  and while the     veneras resolution was comparable to that of similar observations      made by the 300meter 1000foot arecibo radio telescope on the      island of puerto rico the orbiters would be examining the northern     pole of venus  this region was unobtainable by either arecibo or      pioneer venus and appeared to contain a number of potentially      interesting geological features worthy of investigation          on october 10 1983 after an interplanetary journey of 330      million kilometers 198 million miles and two midcourse corrections      venera 15 fired its braking rockets over venus to place itself in a      polar orbit 1000 by 65000 kilometers 600 by 39000 miles around      the planet completing one revolution every twentyfour hours  venera      16 followed suit four days later  the twin probes thus became venus      first polarcircling spacecraft          radar operations began on october 16 for venera 15 and october 20      for venera 16  for up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north     pole the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers      ninety miles wide and nine thousand kilometers 5400 miles long       the craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over      the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back      to two large soviet antennae on earth  each strip of information took      eight hours to process by computer  by the end of their main missions      in july of 1984 the veneras had mapped 115 million square kilometers      46 million square miles thirty percent of the entire planet          venera 15 and 16 revealed that venus has a surface geology more     complex than shown by pioneer venus in the late 1970s  numerous hills      mountains ridges valleys and plains spread across the landscape      many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the      last one billion years  in planetary terms this makes the venerean      surface rather young  hundreds of craters were detected as well the      largest of which had to have been created by meteorites planetoids      would be a better term here at least fourteen kilometers 84 miles      across due to venus very dense atmosphere          there were some disagreements between us and soviet scientists     on the origins of certain surface features  for example the probes      owners declared that the 96kilometer 576mile wide crater at the      summit of 10800meter 35640foot high maxwell montes the tallest      mountain on the planet was the result of a meteorite impact  american      scientists on the other hand felt the crater was proof that maxwell      was a huge volcano sitting on the northern continent of ishtar terra            in any event the us decided to wait on making verdicts about     venus until the arrival of their own radar probe scheduled for later     in the decade  originally named the venus orbiting imaging radar     voir its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig     nated the venus radar mapper vrm  eventually the machine would be      called magellan after the portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan      circa 14801521  this vehicle would map the entire planet in even      finer detail than the veneras  for the time however the soviet      probes maintained that distinction          radar imaging was not the only ability of the veneras  bolted     next to the polyus v radar antenna were the omega altimeter and the      fourier infrared spectrometer the latter for measuring the worlds     temperatures  the majority of the areas covered registered about     five hundred degrees celsius 932 degrees fahrenheit but a few     locations were two hundred degrees hotter possibly indicating      current volcanic activity  the probes also found that the clouds      over the poles were five to eight kilometers three to 48 miles      lower than at the equator  in contrast the polar air above sixty      kilometers thirtysix miles altitude was five to twenty degrees      warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights          when the main mapping mission ended in july of 1984 there were      plans for at least one of the veneras to radar image the surface at      more southernly latitudes  unfortunately this idea did not come to      pass as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitudecontrol     gas to perform the operation            venera 15 and 16 ceased transmission in march of 1985 leaving      the soviet institute of radiotechnology and electronics with six      hundred kilometers 360 miles of radar data tape to sort into an      atlas of twentyseven maps of the northern hemisphere of venus          venus by balloon          for years the thick atmosphere of venus had been a tempting      target to scientists who wished to explore the planets mantle of      air with balloonborne instruments  professor jacques blamont of      the french space agency centre national detudes spatiales cnes     had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967 only to have a joint      frenchsoviet balloon mission canceled in 1982  nevertheless      late in the year 1984 such dreams would eventually come true          when two proton rockets were sent skyward on december 15 and 21      the soviet union provided western observers with the first clear full      views of the booster which had been launching every soviet venus probe      since 1975  this was but one of many firsts for the complex mission          the unmanned probes launched into space that december were named     vega 1 and 2 a contraction of the words venera and gallei  gallei     being the russian word for halley  not only did the spacecraft      have more than one mission to perform they also had more than one      celestial objective to explore namely the comet halley            this famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to      the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910     since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from     the formation of the solar system five billion years ago scientists      around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such      bodies which actually come close to earth            most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar      system  some like halley are perturbed by various forces and fall      in towards the sun where they circle for millennia spewing out ice      and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar      encounter          the soviet union along with the european space agency esa and     japans institute of space and astronautical science isas did not     wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a     close examination of halley  the esa would be using the cylindrical     giotto probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the      comet while japans first deep space craft  sakigake pioneer and      suisei comet  would view halley from a much safer distance           scientists in the united states also desired to study the comet     from the vantage of a space probe at one time envisioning a vessel     powered by solar sails or ion engines  however government budget     cuts to nasa canceled the american efforts  the us would have to     make do primarily with earthbased observations and the sharing of      data from other nations though an instrument named the dust counter      and mass analyzer ducma designed by chicago university professor      john simpson was added on the soviet mission in may of 1984          the soviets answer to halley were the vegas  instead of building     an entirely new craft for the mission the soviets decided to modify     their venera bus design to encounter the comet while performing an      advanced venus mission along the way  as vega 1 and 2 reached venus     the buses would drop off one landerballoon each and use the mass of      the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet halley much as the      us probe mariner 10 used venus to flyby mercury eleven years earlier      the soviet craft would then head on to halley helping to pinpoint the      location of the comets erupting nucleus for the giotto probe to dive      in only 605 kilometers 363 miles away in march of 1986          as planned the two vegas arrived at venus in june of 1985  vega     1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month the lander     making a twoday descent towards the planet  the craft touched the     upper atmosphere on the morning of june 11  sixtyone kilometers     366 miles above the venerean surface a small container was released     by the lander which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers 33 miles     altitude  thus the first balloon probe ever to explore venus had     successfully arrived           one kilometer after the opening of the parachute helium gas was     pumped into the tefloncoated plastic balloon inflating it to a     diameter of 354 meters 1168 feet  dangling on a tether thirteen     meters 429 feet below was the instrument package properly known as     an aerostat  the top part of the 69kilogram 1518pound aerostat     consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment     point to the balloon  beneath it was the transmitter electronics     and instruments  connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for     measuring cloud particles  the aerostat was painted with a special     white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which     permeated the planets atmosphere           the vega 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of venus just     north of the equator  scientists were concerned that the gas bag      would burst in the heat of daylight so they placed it in the darkened      hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data       this action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as      well effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions       the author wonders though if they could have used floodlights similar      to the ones attached to venera 9 and 10 in 1975 when soviet scientists      had thought the planets surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight      due to the permanently thick cloud cover          the first balloon transmitted for 465 hours right into the day     hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed covering 11600     kilometers 6960 miles  the threat of bursting in the day heat did     not materialize  the vega 1 balloon was stationed at a 54kilometer     324mile altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers     thirty miles for this was considered the most active of the three     main cloud layers reported by pioneer venus in 1978  indeed the     balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers     150 miles per hour  strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and     down two to three hundred meters 660 to 990 feet through most of the     journey  the layers air temperature averaged forty degrees celsius     104 degrees fahrenheit and pressure was a mere 05 earth atmosphere     the nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds           early in the first balloons flight the vega 1 lander was already     headed towards the venerean surface  both landers were equipped with     a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on venera 13      and 14 in 1982  however vega 1 would become unable to report the     composition of the ground at its landing site in rusalka planitia the     mermaid plain north of aphrodite terra  while still ten to fifteen     minutes away from landing a timer malfunction caused the drill to      accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers 96      miles above the surface           there was neither any way to shut off the instrument before     touchdown nor reactivate it after landing  this was unfortunate not     only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of     venus was covered with such smooth lowlevel lava plains and had never      before been directly examined  nevertheless the surface temperature      and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees celsius 8744 degrees      fahrenheit and 95 earth atmospheres respectively during the landers      56 minutes of ground transmissions  a large amount of background      infrared radiation was also recorded at the site          as had been done when the drills and cameras on venera 11 and      12 had failed in december of 1978 the soviets focused on the data     returned during the landers plunge through the atmosphere  the     frenchsoviet malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur chlorine      and possibly phosphorus  it is the sulfur  possibly from active      volcanoes  which gives the venerean clouds their yellowish color     the sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air     between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers 288 and 378 miles     contained one milligram 0015 grain of sulfuric acid          the vega 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks      appeared to be at odds with the information from pioneer venus     the case was made even stronger by the fact that vega 2s results     nearly matched its twin  the vegas found only two main cloud layers      instead of the three reported by the us probes  the layers were      three to five kilometers 18 to 3 miles thick at altitudes of 50      and 58 kilometers 30 and 348 miles  the clouds persisted like a     thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers 21 miles      much lower than the pv readings  one possibility for the discrepan     cies may have been radical structural changes in the venerean air      over the last seven years          when the lander and balloon finally went silent the last      functioning part of the vega 1 mission the flyby bus sailed on     for a 708 millionkilometer 4248 millionmile journey around     the sun to become the first probe to meet comet halley  on march     6 1986 the bus made a 8890kilometer 5334mile pass at the      dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space     the soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial     bodies with one space vessel          on june 13 vega 2 released its landerballoon payload for     a twoday fall towards venus  like its duplicate the vega 2     balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking     it on earth for 465 hours before battery failure on the morning     side of the planet  during its 11100kilometer 6660mile     flight over venus the second balloon entered in a rather still     environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission     after 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent      for a further eight hours  when the balloon passed over a five     kilometer threemile mountain on the continent of aphrodite      terra a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 25 kilometers 15      miles towards the surface          temperature sensors on the vega 2 balloon reported that the air      layer it was moving through was consistently 65 degrees celsius      437 degrees fahrenheit cooler than the area explored by the vega 1     balloon  this was corroborated by the vega 2 lander as it passed      through the balloons level  no positive indications of lightning     were made by either balloon and the second aerostats nephelometer      failed to function          the vega 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of aphrodite     terras western arm on the fifteenth of june 1500 kilometers 900     miles southeast of vega 1  the landers resting place was smoother     than thought indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a     relatively young one covered in fresh lava  the soil drill was in     working order and reported a rock type known as anorthositetroctolite      rare on earth but present in lunas highlands  this rock is rich in      aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium  a high degree      of sulfur was also present in the soil  the air around vega 2 measured      463 degrees celsius 8654 degrees fahrenheit and 91 earth atmospheres     essentially a typical day or night on venus          far above the vega 2 lander its carrier bus sped past venus at     a distance of 24500 kilometers 14700 miles and followed its twin      to comet halley making a closer flyby on march 9 1986 at just 8030      kilometers 4818 miles  both probes helped to reveal that the comet      is a very dark and irregularshaped mass about fourteen kilometers      84 miles across rotating once every 53 hours give or take three      hours          since both vega craft were still functioning after their halley     encounters soviet scientists considered an option to send the      probes to other celestial objects  one prime target was the near     earth planetoid 2101 adonis which vega 2 could pass at a distance      of six million kilometers 36 million miles  sadly the soviets      had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly      a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was      not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach adonis as planned       vega 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987          future plans diverted          the impressive vega mission had given some scientists numerous      ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second      world from the sun  one example was the vesta mission planned for     the early 1990s          this sovietfrench collaboration called for the launch of multiple      probes on a single proton rocket in either 1991 or 1992  the craft      would first swing by venus and drop off several landers and balloon      probes  the aerostats would be designed to survive in the planets      corrosive atmosphere for up to one month a large improvement over      the vega balloons two days  the mission would then head out to      investigate several planetoids and comets including a possible      landing on vesta thus the mission name the most reflective main      belt planetoid as seen from earth          unfortunately for venus exploration plans began to change in     the soviet union  in 1986 the soviets decided to reroute the vesta     mission to the red planet mars instead of venus keeping the comet     and planetoid aspects intact  by this time in the soviet space      program interest was focusing on mars  already under construction      was an entirely new probe design called phobos  two members of this      class were planned to leave earth in 1988 and orbit mars the next      year  phobos 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on     mars largest moon phobos           all this was a prelude to even more advanced mars expeditions     including balloon probes rovers soil sample return craft and      eventually human explorers in the early twentyfirst century     the environment of venus was just too hostile for any serious     consideration of human colonization in the near future          but things began to look bleak for soviet venus and mars     exploration  both phobos probes failed to complete their missions     one losing contact on the way to the red planet in 1988 and the other     going silent in mars orbit just one week before the planned moon     landing in march of 1989           in 1989 a plan was devised for a venus orbiter to drop eight to     ten penetrators around the planet in 1998  several years later the     mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put      on indefinite hold  no other official soviet missions to venus have     since been put forth a sad commentary after twentyfive years of     continuous robotic exploration of the planet           during the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change     was taking over the soviet union  president mikhail gorbachev began      to open up his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with      the rest of the nations particularly those in the west  while the      culture became less oppressive than in the past the economy was taking      a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a free market          these effects hit everywhere including the space program     missions at all levels were cut back  the soviets began making     almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other spacefaring     nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to      make money            in early 1992 it was reported that the soviets were offering for      sale several fullyequipped veneras they had in storage for the price      of 16 million dollars each an incredibly low price for any planetary      probe  no nation took them up on the bargain  meanwhile the united      states was gearing up for new venus missions of their own          magellan and galileo           the us reactivated their longdormant planetary exploration     with the launch of the space shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989     aboard the shuttle was the magellan spacecraft a combination of     spare parts from other us probes designed to make the most      detailed and complete radarmapping of venus in history  when     magellan reached the second world in august of 1990 it would be     able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108     meters 360 feet surpassing the abilities of venera 15 and 16          in the interim another american probe was launched from a space      shuttle which would make a quick flyby of venus on its way to orbit      the giant planet jupiter in 1995  on october 18 1989 the shuttle      atlantis released its second unmanned planetary probe into space      named galileo after the famous italian astronomer who discovered the      probes primary targets major moons in 1610          in the absence of a powerful enough booster to send galileo on     a direct flight to the jovian planet the probe was sent around     venus and earth several times to build up enough speed to reach     jupiter  as a result venus became galileos first planetary     goal in february of 1990  the probe radioed back images of the     planets swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in     that violent atmosphere          on the drawing boards          with the incredible success of magellan in the last few years     new plans have been laid out for further journeys to venus  scien     tists in the us have talked to space scientists in the former soviet      union  now the commonwealth of independent states since january 1      1992  of a cooperative effort to launch new venera lander missions      within in the next decade  japan india and the esa have also     considered their own venus missions in the next few decades          in february of 1993 nasa came up with several new venus projects      as part of their discovery program for launching inexpensive probes     throughout the solar system  for venus two missions were selected     for further study  a venus multiprobe mission involving the landing     of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds air     temperature and pressure and the venus composition probe designed     to study venus atmosphere while descending through the thick air     with the aid of a parachute much as the soviets had done since 1967     final project decisions will be made in 1994          humans on venus                will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of venus     at present the leadmelting temperatures and crushing air pressure     would be threatening to any earth life not protected in something     even tougher than a venera lander  plans have been looked into     changing the environment of venus itself into something more like     earths  however it should be noted that any such undertaking     will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide      atmosphere a major reduction in surface heat and the ability      to speed up the planets rotation rate to something a bit faster     than once every 243 earth days  such a project may take centuries     if not millennia          in the meantime efforts should be made to better understand     venus as its exists today  we still have yet to fully know how     a world so seemingly similar to earth in many important ways became     instead such a deadly place  will earth ever suffer this fate     perhaps venus holds the answers  such answers may best be found     through international cooperation including the nation which      made the first attempts to

jon livesey writes    noting that a particular society in this case the mainland uk  has few religously motivated murders and few murders of any  kind says very little about whether interreligion murders elsewhere  are religiously motivated    no but it allows one to conclude that there is nothing inherent  in all religion or for that matter in catholicism and protestantism  that motivates one to kill  motivates or allows    the christian bible says that one may kill under certain circumstances   in fact it instructs one to kill under certain circumstances       id say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them to kill under certain circumstances  i do get your distinction between motivate and allow and i do agree that if a flavour of theism allows atoricities then thats an indictment of that theism  but it rather depends on what the certain circumstances are  when you talk about christianity or islam then at least your claims can be understood its when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls apart  one could believe in a god which instructs one to be utterly harmless   for my part i conclude that something  else is required  i also happen to believe that that something  else will work no less well without religion  any easy themus will  do  and what does religion supply if not an easy themus  not necessarily  love thy neighbour does not supply a themus  it demolishes it  and my definition of religion is broader than my definition of theism as i have explained   by insisting that even the murder of four labourers chosen because  they were catholics and who had nothing to do with the ira by   protestant extremists is not religously motivated i think what   you are saying is that you simply will not accept any murder as   being religiously motivated    no  what about that guy who cut off someones head because he believed   he was the devil incarnate  that was religously motivated  what about the protestant extremists who killed four catholic  labourers     that wasnt religiously motivated  not in my opinion  if they were doing it because of some obscure point of theology then yes  but since all protestants dont do this nor do they elect extremists to do it for them its just too broad too say religion did this  im saying that the causes are far more complex than that  take away the religious element and youd still have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism  you know when most catholics and protestants worldwide say stop the  killing one might listen to that especially when you claim not to read minds    also the murders ensuing from the fatwa on mr rushdie the inquisitions  and the many religous wars  whats so special about these exceptions    isnt this all just a grabbag of adhoc excuses for not considering some other murders to be religiously motivated    whats the general principle behind all this  the general principle is that its fairly clear to me at least that religion is the primary motivator enabler whatever of these  its not nearly so obvious whats going on when one looks at ni apart from violence of course   its not an abstract argument   northern irish protestants say  we dont want to be absorbed into am officially catholic country    now what are we supposed to do   are we supposed to reply no  thats only what you think you dont want   mr odwyer assures us  that no matter what you say you want you really want something   else    you think the unionists wouldnt mind being absorbed into a noncatholic   country other than the uk of course   its a terrible thing to lose  a mind   maybe the word country is there for more than just kicks  i certainly dont believe that the unionists are in it for god  i think  they wish to maintain their position of privilege  im still listening to what they say and you are still telling us  your version of what they think   you read minds and i dont  youve speculated on my motives often enough and you dont take my statements of my own beliefs at face value  therefore your claim  not to read minds has no credibility with me sorry   i also note that  you fail to answer my question  it just looks to me very much like you have an axe to grind  especially as you are indeed ignoring what  most protestants say  which is stop the killing  the people you refer to are properly described as unionists not protestants  as for their position of privilege what is that if not religion based  it is based on politics bigotry and heartless extremism  none of these things are synonymous with religion though there is certainly some overlap     frank odwyer                                  im not hatching that odwyersseie                                  from hens  by evelyn conlon ,0

 on what or whose authority do christians proclaim that they  are above the law and above the prophets 7 major and 12 minor and not   accountable to the ten commandments of which jesus clearly spoke his opinion   in matthew 51419 what is the source of this pseudodoctrine who is  the pseudoteacher who is the great deceiver ok heres at least one christians answer jesus was a jew not a christian  in this context matthew 51419 makes sense  matt 517 do not think that i jesus came to abolish the law or the prophets i did not come to abolish but to fulfill  jesus lived under the jewish law  however he was the culmination of the promises of the prophets  he came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey gods purposes verse 18 says for truly i say to you until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law until all is accomplished  the key to this verse imho is the last  phrase  jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the  law was supposed to accomplish    jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the law and unless im mistaken heaven and earth have not yet passed away am i mistaken and even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word of jesus do you really think that all is accomplished  verse 19  whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments and so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven  taken in the context of jesus teaching jewish  people about living lives under the law this makes sense  then why didnt jesus say any jew who annuls  in v 19 are you saying that all of jesus recorded words mean nothing to gentiles are you really saying that jesus only spoke for and to the jews jesus didnt mention your name does that mean he wasnt speaking to you when you read the words of jesus do you think he is speaking to someone other than you  in general it appears that jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about doing away with the law  that was not  jesus intent at all  you said above that jesus was the fulfillment of the law are you saying that does not mean doing away with the law  he had come to earth to live the law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by god to his  people all the way back to eve gen 315the serpent will bruise your  heel but he will bruise his head  gen315jps i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers they shall strike at your head and you shall strike at their heel  gen315nrsv i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers he will strike your head and you will strike his heel  gen315kjv and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel  looks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the word  jesus appeared to be doing away with the law  because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the law of god  he regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only  gods law in the matthew passage jesus is defending his dedication to the law  and defending himself against his accusors  almost the entire sermon  on the mount matt 57 is dedicated to helping the jewish people  understand the true intent of the law sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the pharasees and their traditions  only helping the jewish people  in galatians 32326 paul describes the relationship of jesus to the  law in this way 23 but before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed  24 therefore  the law has become our tutor to lead us to christ that we may be  justified by faith  25  but now that faith has come we are no  longer under a tutor  26 for you are all sons of god through faith  in christ jesus i believe this says that after christ was revealed the law had  served its purpose ie our tutor to lead us to christ and now we are no longer under a tutor  the law has been fulfilled  as christ said he would do  you are using your interpretation of paul as an argument against the clear words of jesus  god the author of the old law and the christman jesus are the same personality  therefore the old law and the new testament the last will and testament of jesus are based on the same moral principles  it makes sense that many of the principles in the old law are reexpressed in christianity   reexpressed care to define that a bit better  on the other hand now that the law has fulfilled its purpose and   what are heaven and earth gone away where did they go is all accomplished for example revelations explain please  christians relate to god through christ not the law it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the mysteries of this new relationship  ie baptism  representing christs death burial and resurrection rom 638 the lords supper as a memorial to his sacrifice i cor 1126 and sunday as a day of worship commemorating his resurrection matt 281ff acts 207  again your interpretation of paul versus the clear word of jesus do you see any problems here when did heaven and earth go away when was all accomplished  ok thats one christians explanation  i dont claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and i welcome other christians to offer other alternatives please
