11,11,from svec5menudouhedu tc zhao subject full color image editor for sgi workstations organization university of houston lines 159 distribution world nntppostinghost menudouhedu      i am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program    an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on sgi gl    besides typical touchup tasks such as crop rotate smooth etc    bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs    such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image     the following is the relevant sections from the man page       prerelease of may 1993                                       bit1l  name    bit  bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations  description   bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on   silicon graphics gl as a full color program bit handles images of both   24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner    as an image viewer bit allows list of images to be displayed in their   original type 24bits or color index in any order and in any of the   many builtin styles of display you can walk up and down the list using   mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the   slideshow  with the pan and zoom features large images can be viewed   in full without being limited by the window or screen size    as an image editor bit performs a large number of image editing and   processing tasks accurately and efficiently it keeps information loss   at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing   subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type   whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion andor quantization of   input images you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into   another  in addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple   geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with   the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take   advantage of the higher printer resolutions eg postscript    bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing   image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence   turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be   accessed by a press of a button and best of all the processed image   will be read back and displayed immediately convolution using exter   nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically   giving great flexibility in processing an image  features    bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a   continuous progress report and once the processing is complete    the processed image will be displayed    current features include    o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of antialiasing     and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color    o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x andor ydirections with     the option of subpixel sampling    o renders text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an     image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving     the text and raster separately such as into a postscript file to     take advantage of a higher printer resolution besides normal text     strings many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as     in tex1 eg alphasmallbeta produces greek alphabet alpha     followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta    o presents graphically the histogram of an image    o performs arbitrary 1to1 pixel transformation  the transformation     function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary     forms further the transformation can be applied to rgb channels     separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of     it many difficult tasks such as thresholding can be accomplished     rather easily by 1to1 transformation in combination with the avai     lability of graphical histograms of the image    o places simple geometric figures sgfs eg arrows circles trian     gles etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at     arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some     user definable coordinate system units with the option of rendering     directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately eg     postscript file all sgfs can be scaled in x and ydirections     independently or simultaneously this is how to get an ellipse from a     circle    o performs edge detection in combination with image histograms and 1     to1 transformation very accurate result can be obtained    o performs histogram equalization    o performs convolution with externally defined square matrices of     arbitrary order    o crops a rectangular portion of an image    o cuts and pastes across images    o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount    o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause     interval between images slideshow    o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels     along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities     or as an intensity vs distance plot    o performs image type conversions    o converts image formats    o smoothes an image special convolution    o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image     back and display it    o modify an individual pixels rgb values    o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the     resulting power spectra    o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this prerelease   supported formats       o  iris rgb native to sgi iris       o  jpegjfif format       o  compuserv gif       o  pnmportable any map including ppm pgm and pbm       o  xbm x window bitmap       o  tiff       o  postscriptwrite only  hardware requirements     any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode including indigoes  where to get it     anonymous ftp to montesvecuhedu   pubbitbitxxxtarz    where xxx is the version number current version is 073     read src01readme for installation instructions after unpacking  acknowledgement     jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groupss library version 4    forms library developed by mark overmars is used for gui    both jpeg and forms library are included in this release     bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate   images the builtin editing features will satisfy most of   your editing needs in addition the external filter and dynamical   kernel will utilize any program you already have so try it   and you will like it      as always any commentsbug reports are welcome  ,1

24,24,from davebpogowvtekcom dave butler subject objectivity was after 2000 years organization tektronix inc wilsonville  or lines 83  this discussion on objective seems to be falling into solipsism eg the recent challenge from frank dwyer for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomena  someones even made the statement that science is subjective and that even atom are subjective this is getting a bit silly and the word objective is losing all meaning  lets start by remembering the definition of objective which has been already presented    objective adj 1 of or having to do with a material object as      distinguished from a mental concept 2 having actual existence     3a unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice b based on     observable phenomenon  the objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that thing eg the world is objectively round regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable phenomenon instead of being based solely on peoples wishes feeling mental processes etc  thus atoms being based on very observable and repeatable phenomenon are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective  even weird high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon even though that observation can change the outcome  nor are those observable phenomenon affected by emotion or personal prejudice eg chemical reactions do not change to the whims of different people  thus to say that science is not objective ie objectively verifiable is a bit silly as that is the point of science  now i will agree that science is not objectively good i will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective   now some examples things which are objective  a d12 tractor is larger than the average breadbox  chlorophyll is green  seawater contains salt there exists ozone in the atmosphere at least presently  ozone blocks  ultraviolet light  ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin cancer  good on the other hand is a value judgement  it doesnt seem to have an existence apart from what we give it unless someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined good  we cannot quantify it touch it or collect it in any concrete sense eg i have a bag full of good  now we do sometimes attempt to give the word good an objective meaning eg  good has been used to denote strength resiliency speed etc  that though is a subjective definition as some might not see strength and etc as necessarily good eg strength inspired by naziism  is not generally viewed as good   as to a morality i cannot say that i have ever seen a morality strictly based on verifiable observable phenomenon  the closest i have seen is some form of the golden rule which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss people off as they will likely then involve themselves in your life in a manner you wont like  this is verifiable when you get in someones face they will often retaliate  another objective fact about morality is that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group and thus can at times ignore that form of the golden rule without fear of reprisal  now as to whether this enforcing of morality is good or bad is quite subjective  by the way remember that subjective does not mean that a thing cannot be formally stated or even commonly agreed upon it only means that that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena or has a physical existence unto itself  also note that i have not stated that there is no such thing as an objective morality or that i could not accept any such a morality i have simply stated that i have seen no evidence of any such morality   one other thing to notice objective is many times used as synonymous with true andor absolute and subjective sometimes has the connotation of false andor relative taint necessarily so  for instance when a conclusion is based on objective but insufficient evidence then it can be both objective and false  as to absolute it is easy to note that while we can objectively show that tnt is explosive but that does not absolutely mean that all tnt will explode and thus objective is not necessarily absolute either  on the other hand something subjective can also be either absolutist or true for instance there are some theists who are specifically absolutist in their morality even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up  further many a scientist and detective has been motivated by subjective reasons eg a gut feeling or hunch to investigate a phenomena or situation and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesis  on the whole though i would have to agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective evidence   9999later  9999dave butler      in starting any thesis it seems to me one should put forward as ones     point of departure something incontrovertible the expression should be     simple and dignified 9999diogenes ,3

26,26,from turpincsutexasedu russell turpin subject re christian metaethics organization cs dept university of texas at austin lines 106 distribution na nntppostinghost im4ucsutexasedu summary in response to dave davis   i wrote  and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted  there  are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward  reading show the christian god behaving in just this way  in article 1r622cc17cassma02bullcom ddaviscassma02bullcom dave davis writes  this requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally  valid that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among  them i wouldnt make that assumption i dont think it is a  reasonable assumption   no  it follows from the fact that most christians choice of interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully determined by scripture  whether or not there is some right interpretation matters not few christians claim the ability to read the mind of their god  dave davis should note that it was michael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural influence in this thread  i think michael is right in this but regardless it should be noted that this has not been a point of contention between michael and myself   i have argued  beyond michaels claims  that the christian scriptures are open to so many interpretations  including a wide divergence within the christian tradition  that even their most important themes are vague  again it does not matter that there is some right interpretation unless there is a way to determine what that right interpretation is  it is the lack of an objective measure not the presumed lack of an answer that puts the force behind the line i argue   michael and i and others read the bible with christian  glasses among the things that this should imply is that the  nt informs the ot even to the point of dominanting it some  points in the ot ceremonial  dietary laws are explicitly   abrogated by the nt texts   there are enough christian glasses varying over a sufficiently broad range of color that i can find a few that support my example    no michael the conservative christians also take the gospel   seriously  what differentiates you is the way you interpret the  gospel   russell turpins no here is misplaced not to say inappropriate  michaels selfdescription must govern  the equation of radical    liberal which seems implied by russell turpin is wrong   in my opinion what makes michael radical is that he fully acknowledges that christian scripture and tradition fail to determine the doctrines that so many branches within christianity hold dear  he is willing to live and practice his religion within this indeterminacy and he is willing to acknowledge that much of his understanding of things christian is influenced by ideas that are not purely christian  those christians i have called conservative must also interpret but they do not recognize  or at least are unwilling to admit  the extent and importance of this   russell turpin in an earlier post had said that michael michaels  theological positions actually didnt tell him much about christianity  dean simeon responds this time gently what do you mean more  direct perhaps would have been what could you possibly mean  the implied rhetorical effort to separate michael from the tradition  is a failure michael is in the tradition if your idea of the tradition  doesnt include him change your idea of the tradition  i recognize that michael is part of the tradition  but what does it tell one about a tradition covering origen aquinas jerry fallwell and jesse jackson that it also includes michael siemon not very much    in short it is the extrachristian principles that make  michaels christianity beneficial and i suspect they would  be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by  christian interpretation     this conclusion does not follow even in short from the  argument that goes before a surprising logical ellipsis  i think the conclusion does follow  the purely christian principles that michael has are the ones he shares with others in the christian tradition or that can be derived from christian scripture  these necessarily vague are not enough to drive his political stances  that one should love ones neighbor is a  purely christian principle  that this means showing tolerance  for homosexuality is not  as to these political stances they are often at odds with what is commonly held in most of current christendom and so i  suspect they could be better pressed outside it  on the other hand i can well understand the counterpoint that these  political stances become most influential when presented to  those who need them most    this is a theological statement worthy of barth  dr turpin dd may wear the black robe of geneva yet   having barely survived the effort to finish in computer science i doubt i will attempt a more difficult field any time soon  russell  ,3

regret the actual killing   if we hadnt intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would  have been appeasement    right  but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action  or  are you just setting up a strawman    im not setting up a strawman at all  if you want to argue against the  war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep  kuwait  false dichotomy   diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective  thats because they werent even attempted   but what about those who didnt support hitlers dreams of conquest  its  not as if they democratically voted for all his policies  the nsdap got  43  in the elections of 1933 and that was the last chance the german   people got to vote on the matter    they suffered along with the rest  why does this bother you so much  you want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were maimed or killed by bombing at the end of ww2 when it was far from clear that such bombing was necessary   the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect  many  innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others  it it regretable  but thats thewayitis  and whyisitthatway  who set things up to be that way   this was happening before the gulf war  why didnt we send in the bombers   to east timor  why arent we sending in the bombers now    probably because were not the saviors of the world  we cant police each  and every country that decides to selfdestruct or invade another  no just the ones that have oil  or the ones that look like they might make a success of communism   nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or  some other places  i dont see that getting un forces to east timor is any harder than getting them to iraq              tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed  amnesty  international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china    why arent we stopping them  in fact why are we actively sucking up to  them by trading freely with them    tell me how we could stop them and ill support it  i for one do not  agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it  i agree that it is deplorable  fine  write to your congressman and to president clinton  chinas status as most favoured nation comes up for renewal in june  point out that the us shouldnt be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime  i doubt anything will happen  clintons keener on trade sanctions against europe   unbelievable comments about the rodney king case deleted    the media is not totally monolithic  even though there is a prevailing  liberal bias programs such as the macneillehrer news hour try to give  a balanced and fair reporting of the news  there are even conservative  sources out there if you know where to look  hurrah for rush  any idea how many kill files you just ended up in   i an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people    you a supposed christian are arguing that its ok to kill innocent people  so long as you get some guilty ones as well    hardly  i didnt say that its a good thing tm to kill innocent people  if the end is just  unfortunately we dont live in a perfect world and  there are no perfect solutions  if one is going to  resist tyranny then  innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die  i didnt say  it is ok  it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary  the ends justify the means eh   you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that i  am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the  war      you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist  the same tired old misunderstanding  moral relativism means that there is no objective standard of morality  it doesnt mean you cant judge other peoples morals  christ on a bike how many times have we tried to hammer that into your head   wheres your christian love  wheres your absolute morality  oh how   quick you are to discard them when it suits you  as ivan stang would say  jesus would puke    one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action  even this discourse in this forum  i understand the full ramifications of  that and i am prepared to do so  i dont believe that you can make the  same claim  obviously not as i am an atheist  i dont think youd get on with jesus though he was a longhaired lunatic peacenik was he not   and btw the reason i brought up the blanketbombing in germany was  because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being   so deplorable  yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing  wasnt accurate enough to hit industrialmilitary targets in a  decisive way by any other method at that time  but in the gulf war  precision bombing was the norm  so the point was why make a big  stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted  in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians  proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing  in ww2  right  unfortunately for you it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that i condemned the bombing of dresden too  i think youre being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy too  you make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door  as i understand it that is not the case we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the german people   civilians suffer  but less civilians suffered in this war than  any other iany other in history  oh come on  with wars like the falklands fresh in peoples minds that sort of propaganda isnt going to fool anyone                                                         the stories  of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk  yes bunk  the us lost 230000 servicemen in ww2 over four years  and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting  yes  and what about the millions of casualties the russians suffered  its hardly surprising the us didnt lose many men in ww2 given that you turned up late   mathew ,0

palmerccocaltechedu david m palmer writes garyke4zvuucp gary coffman writes lack of a skeleton means that muscles have to actively resist gravity at all times on land rather than supplying only balancing forces that means that much more energy would be required for the creature to function the bones also supply leverage points for pushing and lateral movement thats why you dont find large  active boneless creatures on land  hydraulics can make rigid tubes  no energy required just for support  hydraulics also allow a creature to produce large forces with weak muscles using the principle of a hydraulic jack rather than a lever  this is one of those yes but things its true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube but even at 2000 psi levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily though its straighton compressive strength is high and its torsional  resistance increase is practically nil on the other grasping member  theres no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature tree roots  are an example given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure increases  its interesting to note that on land creatures are either two legged or 4 legged with tiny insects having 6 or 8 legs but never 3 legged though that would be a  stable configuration it can be argued that 2 legged creatures   kangaroos are 3legged  the specific number of limbs a creature has is an accident of evolution it is hard to make changes in some structures  the panda has a thumb plus as many fingers as its ancestors five on each hand but the thumb is a modified wristbone rather than a modified finger and extra fingers are much more common than extra limbs especially fullyfunctional ones  kangaroos 3limbed i dont think so if you take the view that the tail is a limb then monkeys and kangaroos are 5limbed i think the tail is a different kind of structure grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion i dont know much about panda thumbs so ill ask is it opposable  thermodynamic considerations of surfacevolume relationships would seem to dictate that active complex creatures  stay in a size range similar to what we see about us 6 inch tall intelligent aliens seem unlikely as do those much larger than the elephant  why cant a lemur or a brontosaurus be intelligent  yes i know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus but so far space aliens are also mythical  well i wont say flat out that they cant be intelligent but ill bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why i dont think its likely first let me say that when i say intelligent i mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with or greater than human tool use and tool building ie assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter  its enviroment in a planned way it will do so thats certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence but it will suffice for a putative technological alien  now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought but its generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity this is generally determined by the number of neuron cells and their interconnections so a creature the size of a lemur wouldnt have enough neurons to support complex thought this argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur theres room for a large brain though no indication that one ever developed one reason this may be true is neuronic speed the electrochemical messages  that trigger neurons require time to propagate this makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures so theres little selection pressure for such brains instead a simpler distributed network evolves this doesnt rule out intelligent dinosaurs but it points in that direction  then there are the thermodynamic arguments a tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because its internal heat is rapidly lost due to its high surface to volume ratio i contend that a creature that must spend most of its time and energy feeding wont have the time to develop and exercise intelligence that argument may be somewhat weak the dinosaurs problem is the reverse it must moderate its heat production  because its high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat  im assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function so creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based that tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded but for a creature the size of a brontosaur its activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat whales are similar size but they can reject heat to the ocean a much more efficient sink than air i suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary ie monkey curiousity i doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity  gary   gary coffman ke4zv              you make it      gatechwa4meike4zvgary destructive testing systems     we break it

argument that there has to be more more than what more than we assume  which is what exactly  a most of the people i debate disagree with my premises  hardly debate     otherwise   your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged more than once when i did it you said good question and did not address it  ive addressed it your caricature is not my favourite point needless to say at length in a previous outing and am currently discussing it with  eric rescorla    b theres little point in responding the same points everywhere i do     my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply   you still repeat that point  i do curious since i believe that was the first time ive ever made it not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability to understand you ask me the same question ill give you the same answer especially when in this case i know the answer to be true  i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone is making the same points and im pushed for time then i try to respond what i  believe are the strongest formulations of those points  if that doesnt include your post tough this is usenet and life is tough all over  c since theres a great deal of responses this isnt always feasible  i     do my best to honestly answer questions put to me   you drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others you appear with the same issue every n months and start the dicussion at the beginning again  ive only debated this issue twice in aa and occasionally in ta  the first was in response to simon clippingdales positive assertion that disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals are relative  it doesnt   now simon has dropped out of the debate for some time i take that to mean that he is either busy or bored with the topic  i certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty  do you   d i cant always understand what you say   neither cant i understand you all the time usually one asks what the other side means  usually one does  usually youre clear but sometimes you arent  and i ask you what you mean other times you seem to get extremely uptight  and i feel that im debating against line noise  sometimes i get tired and  sometimes i have other things id rather do  again this is usenet and life is tough all over  youre going to have to deal with it  e youre starting to get personally insulting i may not even put your name     in the hat in future  thats supposed to be a threat  no thats a simple statement and an assertion that i am not answerable to those who offer me baseless insults  for example those who accuse me  of lying about my personal beliefs while also complaining that i dont answer their questions    like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there if only everything would be so easy  what almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there because to all intents and purposes it is there  we had that argument for one your claim that everyone senses it is not founded and you have been asked to give evidence for it often and then the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it is there unless evidence against it has been found  i have no problem with the second statement  i have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that freedom is valuable  the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey and was offered by some other people too essentially that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as freedom  its a good point and im thinking about it   your trick is to say i feel a is not right and so do many i know therefore a is absolutely right it neglects the possibility that these people consider a to be right as an effect of the same process restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject of that process in other words refutes it you make the ontological claim you have to prove it  nonsense  my trick is to say  i feel that a is better than b and so  does almost any disinterested person i ask  best evidence is therefore  that a really is better than b subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b and that the resulting system of values is selfconsistent  now get this  really is better is an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model it may or may not correspond to something true  it is nonetheless a useful assumption  far more useful than the equally assumed relativist  trick to wit  i feel that a is better than b and so does almost any disinterested person i ask  however if even one person disagrees that a is better than b or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of a and b then it is the case that b is better than a for that person and nothing more can be said    i say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise a cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise b eg a terrorist  to do that would be to claim that  a supermajoritys carefully considered morality would be better than the  terrorists  which would of course be true but a nono for an ethical relativist  to claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion  for a similar argument i sense morality is subjective it does not hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by others  if you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively wrong and it turns out not to be the case for you  of course this is possible  it is neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence against objectivism except sometimes in a pragmatic sense  it serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to judgements is absolute and as long as you dont provide evidence for that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to believe your hypothesis  ive done this freedom with the proviso that i still have to  answer jons objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning  further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective you would have to show that it is independent of humans or the attributes above look quite misleading  not really  what evidence is there that anything exists independently of humans  youll be hard pressed to find any that isnt logically equivalent when applied to values  an analogous set of premises would be  premise 1  some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest             route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance             of the estate and down the malahide road  premise 2  i checked it out and found that the shortest route from my             which is much closer  you would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my house to a bar yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim using premises which are logically no different    no morals are a matter of belief so far the people still believe that the shortest way is through the main entrance no agreement on belief here and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it is the shortest way indeed in other words  your analogy works only when one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place if not it is a fallacy  and if this were an argument for objectivism youd be right  it isnt though its a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument against objectivism nor argument for relativism  your gimmick is to assume in the first place that values arent real and to use this to prove that values arent real  in other words you beg the question against me    frank odwyer                                  im not hatching that odwyersseie

lifted off from the tyuratam space center in the kazakhstan      republic  aboard those boosters were a new breed of venera probe      for the planet venus           designated venera 15 and 16 the probes were meant not for landing     yet more spherical craft on the venerean surface but to radar map the     planet in detail from orbit  to accomplish this task the basic     venera design was modified in numerous areas  the central bus core     was made one meter 3937 inches longer to carry the two tons of     propellant required for braking into orbit double the fuel carried by     the venera 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier  extra solar panels     were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large     amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging  the     dishshaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger      to properly transmit this information to earth           atop the buses where landers were usually placed were installed     the 14 by 6meter 462 by 198foot 300kilogram 660pound     polyus v sidelooking radar antennae  the radar system possibly a     terrainimaging version of the nuclearpowered satellites used by      the soviets for earth ocean surveillance would be able to map venus     surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers 062 to 12 miles           the soviet probes imaging parameters were a vast improvement over     the united states pioneer venus orbiter which could reveal objects      no smaller than 75 kilometers 45 miles in diameter  and while the     veneras resolution was comparable to that of similar observations      made by the 300meter 1000foot arecibo radio telescope on the      island of puerto rico the orbiters would be examining the northern     pole of venus  this region was unobtainable by either arecibo or      pioneer venus and appeared to contain a number of potentially      interesting geological features worthy of investigation          on october 10 1983 after an interplanetary journey of 330      million kilometers 198 million miles and two midcourse corrections      venera 15 fired its braking rockets over venus to place itself in a      polar orbit 1000 by 65000 kilometers 600 by 39000 miles around      the planet completing one revolution every twentyfour hours  venera      16 followed suit four days later  the twin probes thus became venus      first polarcircling spacecraft          radar operations began on october 16 for venera 15 and october 20      for venera 16  for up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north     pole the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers      ninety miles wide and nine thousand kilometers 5400 miles long       the craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over      the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back      to two large soviet antennae on earth  each strip of information took      eight hours to process by computer  by the end of their main missions      in july of 1984 the veneras had mapped 115 million square kilometers      46 million square miles thirty percent of the entire planet          venera 15 and 16 revealed that venus has a surface geology more     complex than shown by pioneer venus in the late 1970s  numerous hills      mountains ridges valleys and plains spread across the landscape      many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the      last one billion years  in planetary terms this makes the venerean      surface rather young  hundreds of craters were detected as well the      largest of which had to have been created by meteorites planetoids      would be a better term here at least fourteen kilometers 84 miles      across due to venus very dense atmosphere          there were some disagreements between us and soviet scientists     on the origins of certain surface features  for example the probes      owners declared that the 96kilometer 576mile wide crater at the      summit of 10800meter 35640foot high maxwell montes the tallest      mountain on the planet was the result of a meteorite impact  american      scientists on the other hand felt the crater was proof that maxwell      was a huge volcano sitting on the northern continent of ishtar terra            in any event the us decided to wait on making verdicts about     venus until the arrival of their own radar probe scheduled for later     in the decade  originally named the venus orbiting imaging radar     voir its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig     nated the venus radar mapper vrm  eventually the machine would be      called magellan after the portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan      circa 14801521  this vehicle would map the entire planet in even      finer detail than the veneras  for the time however the soviet      probes maintained that distinction          radar imaging was not the only ability of the veneras  bolted     next to the polyus v radar antenna were the omega altimeter and the      fourier infrared spectrometer the latter for measuring the worlds     temperatures  the majority of the areas covered registered about     five hundred degrees celsius 932 degrees fahrenheit but a few     locations were two hundred degrees hotter possibly indicating      current volcanic activity  the probes also found that the clouds      over the poles were five to eight kilometers three to 48 miles      lower than at the equator  in contrast the polar air above sixty      kilometers thirtysix miles altitude was five to twenty degrees      warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights          when the main mapping mission ended in july of 1984 there were      plans for at least one of the veneras to radar image the surface at      more southernly latitudes  unfortunately this idea did not come to      pass as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitudecontrol     gas to perform the operation            venera 15 and 16 ceased transmission in march of 1985 leaving      the soviet institute of radiotechnology and electronics with six      hundred kilometers 360 miles of radar data tape to sort into an      atlas of twentyseven maps of the northern hemisphere of venus          venus by balloon          for years the thick atmosphere of venus had been a tempting      target to scientists who wished to explore the planets mantle of      air with balloonborne instruments  professor jacques blamont of      the french space agency centre national detudes spatiales cnes     had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967 only to have a joint      frenchsoviet balloon mission canceled in 1982  nevertheless      late in the year 1984 such dreams would eventually come true          when two proton rockets were sent skyward on december 15 and 21      the soviet union provided western observers with the first clear full      views of the booster which had been launching every soviet venus probe      since 1975  this was but one of many firsts for the complex mission          the unmanned probes launched into space that december were named     vega 1 and 2 a contraction of the words venera and gallei  gallei     being the russian word for halley  not only did the spacecraft      have more than one mission to perform they also had more than one      celestial objective to explore namely the comet halley            this famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to      the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910     since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from     the formation of the solar system five billion years ago scientists      around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such      bodies which actually come close to earth            most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar      system  some like halley are perturbed by various forces and fall      in towards the sun where they circle for millennia spewing out ice      and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar      encounter          the soviet union along with the european space agency esa and     japans institute of space and astronautical science isas did not     wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a     close examination of halley  the esa would be using the cylindrical     giotto probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the      comet while japans first deep space craft  sakigake pioneer and      suisei comet  would view halley from a much safer distance           scientists in the united states also desired to study the comet     from the vantage of a space probe at one time envisioning a vessel     powered by solar sails or ion engines  however government budget     cuts to nasa canceled the american efforts  the us would have to     make do primarily with earthbased observations and the sharing of      data from other nations though an instrument named the dust counter      and mass analyzer ducma designed by chicago university professor      john simpson was added on the soviet mission in may of 1984          the soviets answer to halley were the vegas  instead of building     an entirely new craft for the mission the soviets decided to modify     their venera bus design to encounter the comet while performing an      advanced venus mission along the way  as vega 1 and 2 reached venus     the buses would drop off one landerballoon each and use the mass of      the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet halley much as the      us probe mariner 10 used venus to flyby mercury eleven years earlier      the soviet craft would then head on to halley helping to pinpoint the      location of the comets erupting nucleus for the giotto probe to dive      in only 605 kilometers 363 miles away in march of 1986          as planned the two vegas arrived at venus in june of 1985  vega     1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month the lander     making a twoday descent towards the planet  the craft touched the     upper atmosphere on the morning of june 11  sixtyone kilometers     366 miles above the venerean surface a small container was released     by the lander which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers 33 miles     altitude  thus the first balloon probe ever to explore venus had     successfully arrived           one kilometer after the opening of the parachute helium gas was     pumped into the tefloncoated plastic balloon inflating it to a     diameter of 354 meters 1168 feet  dangling on a tether thirteen     meters 429 feet below was the instrument package properly known as     an aerostat  the top part of the 69kilogram 1518pound aerostat     consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment     point to the balloon  beneath it was the transmitter electronics     and instruments  connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for     measuring cloud particles  the aerostat was painted with a special     white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which     permeated the planets atmosphere           the vega 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of venus just     north of the equator  scientists were concerned that the gas bag      would burst in the heat of daylight so they placed it in the darkened      hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data       this action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as      well effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions       the author wonders though if they could have used floodlights similar      to the ones attached to venera 9 and 10 in 1975 when soviet scientists      had thought the planets surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight      due to the permanently thick cloud cover          the first balloon transmitted for 465 hours right into the day     hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed covering 11600     kilometers 6960 miles  the threat of bursting in the day heat did     not materialize  the vega 1 balloon was stationed at a 54kilometer     324mile altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers     thirty miles for this was considered the most active of the three     main cloud layers reported by pioneer venus in 1978  indeed the     balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers     150 miles per hour  strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and     down two to three hundred meters 660 to 990 feet through most of the     journey  the layers air temperature averaged forty degrees celsius     104 degrees fahrenheit and pressure was a mere 05 earth atmosphere     the nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds           early in the first balloons flight the vega 1 lander was already     headed towards the venerean surface  both landers were equipped with     a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on venera 13      and 14 in 1982  however vega 1 would become unable to report the     composition of the ground at its landing site in rusalka planitia the     mermaid plain north of aphrodite terra  while still ten to fifteen     minutes away from landing a timer malfunction caused the drill to      accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers 96      miles above the surface           there was neither any way to shut off the instrument before     touchdown nor reactivate it after landing  this was unfortunate not     only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of     venus was covered with such smooth lowlevel lava plains and had never      before been directly examined  nevertheless the surface temperature      and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees celsius 8744 degrees      fahrenheit and 95 earth atmospheres respectively during the landers      56 minutes of ground transmissions  a large amount of background      infrared radiation was also recorded at the site          as had been done when the drills and cameras on venera 11 and      12 had failed in december of 1978 the soviets focused on the data     returned during the landers plunge through the atmosphere  the     frenchsoviet malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur chlorine      and possibly phosphorus  it is the sulfur  possibly from active      volcanoes  which gives the venerean clouds their yellowish color     the sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air     between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers 288 and 378 miles     contained one milligram 0015 grain of sulfuric acid          the vega 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks      appeared to be at odds with the information from pioneer venus     the case was made even stronger by the fact that vega 2s results     nearly matched its twin  the vegas found only two main cloud layers      instead of the three reported by the us probes  the layers were      three to five kilometers 18 to 3 miles thick at altitudes of 50      and 58 kilometers 30 and 348 miles  the clouds persisted like a     thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers 21 miles      much lower than the pv readings  one possibility for the discrepan     cies may have been radical structural changes in the venerean air      over the last seven years          when the lander and balloon finally went silent the last      functioning part of the vega 1 mission the flyby bus sailed on     for a 708 millionkilometer 4248 millionmile journey around     the sun to become the first probe to meet comet halley  on march     6 1986 the bus made a 8890kilometer 5334mile pass at the      dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space     the soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial     bodies with one space vessel          on june 13 vega 2 released its landerballoon payload for     a twoday fall towards venus  like its duplicate the vega 2     balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking     it on earth for 465 hours before battery failure on the morning     side of the planet  during its 11100kilometer 6660mile     flight over venus the second balloon entered in a rather still     environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission     after 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent      for a further eight hours  when the balloon passed over a five     kilometer threemile mountain on the continent of aphrodite      terra a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 25 kilometers 15      miles towards the surface          temperature sensors on the vega 2 balloon reported that the air      layer it was moving through was consistently 65 degrees celsius      437 degrees fahrenheit cooler than the area explored by the vega 1     balloon  this was corroborated by the vega 2 lander as it passed      through the balloons level  no positive indications of lightning     were made by either balloon and the second aerostats nephelometer      failed to function          the vega 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of aphrodite     terras western arm on the fifteenth of june 1500 kilometers 900     miles southeast of vega 1  the landers resting place was smoother     than thought indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a     relatively young one covered in fresh lava  the soil drill was in     working order and reported a rock type known as anorthositetroctolite      rare on earth but present in lunas highlands  this rock is rich in      aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium  a high degree      of sulfur was also present in the soil  the air around vega 2 measured      463 degrees celsius 8654 degrees fahrenheit and 91 earth atmospheres     essentially a typical day or night on venus          far above the vega 2 lander its carrier bus sped past venus at     a distance of 24500 kilometers 14700 miles and followed its twin      to comet halley making a closer flyby on march 9 1986 at just 8030      kilometers 4818 miles  both probes helped to reveal that the comet      is a very dark and irregularshaped mass about fourteen kilometers      84 miles across rotating once every 53 hours give or take three      hours          since both vega craft were still functioning after their halley     encounters soviet scientists considered an option to send the      probes to other celestial objects  one prime target was the near     earth planetoid 2101 adonis which vega 2 could pass at a distance      of six million kilometers 36 million miles  sadly the soviets      had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly      a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was      not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach adonis as planned       vega 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987          future plans diverted          the impressive vega mission had given some scientists numerous      ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second      world from the sun  one example was the vesta mission planned for     the early 1990s          this sovietfrench collaboration called for the launch of multiple      probes on a single proton rocket in either 1991 or 1992  the craft      would first swing by venus and drop off several landers and balloon      probes  the aerostats would be designed to survive in the planets      corrosive atmosphere for up to one month a large improvement over      the vega balloons two days  the mission would then head out to      investigate several planetoids and comets including a possible      landing on vesta thus the mission name the most reflective main      belt planetoid as seen from earth          unfortunately for venus exploration plans began to change in     the soviet union  in 1986 the soviets decided to reroute the vesta     mission to the red planet mars instead of venus keeping the comet     and planetoid aspects intact  by this time in the soviet space      program interest was focusing on mars  already under construction      was an entirely new probe design called phobos  two members of this      class were planned to leave earth in 1988 and orbit mars the next      year  phobos 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on     mars largest moon phobos           all this was a prelude to even more advanced mars expeditions     including balloon probes rovers soil sample return craft and      eventually human explorers in the early twentyfirst century     the environment of venus was just too hostile for any serious     consideration of human colonization in the near future          but things began to look bleak for soviet venus and mars     exploration  both phobos probes failed to complete their missions     one losing contact on the way to the red planet in 1988 and the other     going silent in mars orbit just one week before the planned moon     landing in march of 1989           in 1989 a plan was devised for a venus orbiter to drop eight to     ten penetrators around the planet in 1998  several years later the     mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put      on indefinite hold  no other official soviet missions to venus have     since been put forth a sad commentary after twentyfive years of     continuous robotic exploration of the planet           during the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change     was taking over the soviet union  president mikhail gorbachev began      to open up his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with      the rest of the nations particularly those in the west  while the      culture became less oppressive than in the past the economy was taking      a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a free market          these effects hit everywhere including the space program     missions at all levels were cut back  the soviets began making     almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other spacefaring     nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to      make money            in early 1992 it was reported that the soviets were offering for      sale several fullyequipped veneras they had in storage for the price      of 16 million dollars each an incredibly low price for any planetary      probe  no nation took them up on the bargain  meanwhile the united      states was gearing up for new venus missions of their own          magellan and galileo           the us reactivated their longdormant planetary exploration     with the launch of the space shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989     aboard the shuttle was the magellan spacecraft a combination of     spare parts from other us probes designed to make the most      detailed and complete radarmapping of venus in history  when     magellan reached the second world in august of 1990 it would be     able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108     meters 360 feet surpassing the abilities of venera 15 and 16          in the interim another american probe was launched from a space      shuttle which would make a quick flyby of venus on its way to orbit      the giant planet jupiter in 1995  on october 18 1989 the shuttle      atlantis released its second unmanned planetary probe into space      named galileo after the famous italian astronomer who discovered the      probes primary targets major moons in 1610          in the absence of a powerful enough booster to send galileo on     a direct flight to the jovian planet the probe was sent around     venus and earth several times to build up enough speed to reach     jupiter  as a result venus became galileos first planetary     goal in february of 1990  the probe radioed back images of the     planets swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in     that violent atmosphere          on the drawing boards          with the incredible success of magellan in the last few years     new plans have been laid out for further journeys to venus  scien     tists in the us have talked to space scientists in the former soviet      union  now the commonwealth of independent states since january 1      1992  of a cooperative effort to launch new venera lander missions      within in the next decade  japan india and the esa have also     considered their own venus missions in the next few decades          in february of 1993 nasa came up with several new venus projects      as part of their discovery program for launching inexpensive probes     throughout the solar system  for venus two missions were selected     for further study  a venus multiprobe mission involving the landing     of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds air     temperature and pressure and the venus composition probe designed     to study venus atmosphere while descending through the thick air     with the aid of a parachute much as the soviets had done since 1967     final project decisions will be made in 1994          humans on venus                will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of venus     at present the leadmelting temperatures and crushing air pressure     would be threatening to any earth life not protected in something     even tougher than a venera lander  plans have been looked into     changing the environment of venus itself into something more like     earths  however it should be noted that any such undertaking     will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide      atmosphere a major reduction in surface heat and the ability      to speed up the planets rotation rate to something a bit faster     than once every 243 earth days  such a project may take centuries     if not millennia          in the meantime efforts should

tgkcstorontoedu todd kelley writes  in light of what happened in waco i need to get something of my  chest  sadly understandable     faith and dogma are dangerous    yes     religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma and  for that reason i scorn religion   to be fair you should really qualify this as semiticwestern religions but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway   i have expressed this notion in the past  some christians debated  with me whether christianity leaves any room for reasoning  i claimed  rationality is quelled out of christianity by faith and dogma  again this should really be evaluated at a personal level  for example there was only one jesus presumably and he probably didnt say all that many things and yet seemingly billions and billions of christian sects have arisen  perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in christ as in pantheism  it would seem to go against the bible but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal interpretation   a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind  whereas a christian cannot due to the nature of faith and dogma present  in any religion  this is a good point  we have here the quintessential christian he sets up a system of valuesbeliefs for himself which work very well and every eventexperience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system  however we also have an individual who has the inability at least not without some difficulty to change which is important because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system one cannot be open minded to the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein unless of course all the tests fail  in other words the fairer way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the biasresponsibility of losingretaining a system     i claimed that a christian philosopher is not a christian  but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those  of christianity consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison  is not a prisoner unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone  in a prison  can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison  can we define a christian to be someone who at the moment has christian  beliefs  no because if a person is free to go he is not a prisoner  similarly if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma he is not  a christian  interesting but again when it seems to basically boil down to individual nuances although not always i will admit and probably it is the massoriented divisions which are the most appalling it becomes irrelevant unfortunately     i admit its a word game  im going by the dictionary definition of religion     religion n 1 concern over what exists beyond the visible world       differentiated from philosophy in that it operates through faith       or intuition rather than reason                                      websters    now lets go beyond the word game  i dont claim that religion  causes genocide  i think that if all humans were atheist there  would still be genocide  there will always be humans who dont think  there will always be humans who dont ask themselves what is  the real difference between themselves and people with different  colored skin or a different language or different beliefs    granted   religion is like the gun that doesnt kill anybody  religion encourages  faith and dogma and although it doesnt directly condemn people  it encourages the use of just because thinking  it is  just because thinking that kills people    in which case the people become the bullets and the religion as the gun merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves if i may be so bold as to extend your similie   sure religion has many good qualities  it encourages benevolence  and philanthropy  ok so take out only the bad things like faith  dogma and tradition  put in the good things like careful reasoning  and science  the result is secular humanism  wouldnt it  be nice if everyone were a secular humanist   to please the  supernaturalists you might even leave god in there but the secular  emphasis would cause the supernaturalists to start thinking and  they too would realize that a belief in a god really doesnt put  anyone further ahead in understanding the universe ok im just  poking fun at the supernaturalists   also understandable      of course not all humans are capable of thought and wed still  have genocide and maybe even some mass suicidebut not as much  im willing to bet on that    todd     todd kelley

space administration  jet propulsion laboratory california institue of technology pasadena california   for a printed copy of this publication contact the public mail office at the nasa center in your geographic region    introduction       from our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousands of years ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars they called these objects planets meaning wanderers and named them after roman deities  jupiter king of the gods mars the god of war mercury messenger of the gods venus the god of love and beauty and saturn father of jupiter and god of agriculture the stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky       science flourished during the european renaissance fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered and the orbits of the planets around the sun were calculated in the 17th century astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries       but the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration advancements in rocketry after world war ii enabled our machines to break the grip of earths gravity and travel to the moon and to other planets       the united states has sent automated spacecraft then humancrewed expeditions to explore the moon our automated machines have orbited and landed on venus and mars explored the suns environment observed comets and made closerange surveys while flying past mercury jupiter saturn uranus and neptune       these travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system through the electronic sight and other senses of our automated spacecraft color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to earthbound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light and dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered       future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century        automated spacecraft       the national aeronautics and space administrations nasas automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes while they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives the craft share much in common       each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission supported by basic subsystems for electrical power trajectory and orientation control as well as for processing data and communicating with earth       electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems nasa uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power       imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target to help prevent such a mishap a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft       the thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars just as earths early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space with the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference flight controllers can keep a spacecrafts scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the crafts communications antennas pointed toward earth the thrusters can also be used to finetune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory       between 1959 and 1971 nasa spacecraft were dispatched to study the moon and the solar environment they also scanned the inner planets other than earth  mercury venus and mars these three worlds and our own are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solidrock composition       for the early planetary reconnaissance missions nasa employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the mariners their flights helped shape the planning of later missions between 1962 and 1975 seven mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space       all of the mariners used solar panels as their primary power source the first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells other mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies       although the mariners ranged from the mariner 2 venus spacecraft weighing in at 203 kilograms 447 pounds to the mariner 9 mars orbiter weighing in at 974 kilograms 2147 pounds their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program the mariner 5 venus spacecraft for example had originally been a backup for the mariner 4 mars flyby the mariner 10 spacecraft sent to venus and mercury used components left over from the mariner 9 mars orbiter program       in 1972 nasa launched pioneer 10 a jupiter spacecraft interest was shifting to four of the outer planets  jupiter saturn uranus and neptune  giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed       four nasa spacecraft in all  two pioneers and two voyagers  were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar system because of the distances involved these travelers took anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations barring faster spacecraft they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars because the suns light becomes so faint in the outer solar system these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes       nasa also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors mars and venus in the middle and late 1970s twin viking landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories two advanced orbiters  descendants of the mariner craft  carried the viking landers from earth and then studied martian features from above       two drumshaped pioneer spacecraft visited venus in 1978 the pioneer venus orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to see through the planets dense cloud cover to study surface features the pioneer venus multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds the probes and the main body  all of which contained scientific instruments  radioed information about the planets atmosphere during their descent toward the surface       a new generation of automated spacecraft  including magellan galileo ulysses mars observer the comet rendezvousasteroid flyby craf and cassini  is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet        the sun       a discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the sun the sun dwarfs the other bodies representing approximately 9986 percent of all the mass in the solar system all of the planets moons asteroids comets dust and gas add up to only about 014 percent this 014 percent represents the material left over from the suns formation one hundred and nine earths would be required to fit across the suns disk and its interior could hold over 13 million earths       as a star the sun generates energy through the process of fusion the temperature at the suns core is 15 million degrees celsius 27 million degrees fahrenheit and the pressure there is 340 billion times earths air pressure at sea level the suns surface temperature of 5500 degrees celsius 10000 degrees fahrenheit seems almost chilly compared to its coretemperature at the solar core hydrogen can fuse into helium producing energy the sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles both extending far beyond the planets       the sun appears to have been active for 46 billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so at the end of its life the sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up ultimately growing so large that it will swallow earth after a billion years as a red giant it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf  the final end product of a star like ours it may take a trillion years to cool off completely       many spacecraft have explored the suns environment but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately twothirds of the distance from earth to the sun pioneers 511 the pioneer venus orbiter voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment the ulysses spacecraft launched on october 6 1990 is a joint solar mission of nasa and the european space agency after using jupiters gravity to change its trajectory ulysses will fly over the suns polar regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments       we are fortunate that the sun is exactly the way it is if it were different in almost any way life would almost certainly never have developed on earth        mercury       obtaining the first closeup views of mercury was the primary objective of the mariner 10 spacecraft launched on november 3 1973 from kennedy space center in florida after a journey of nearly five months which included a flyby of venus the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers 437 miles of the solar systems innermost planet on march 29 1974       until mariner 10 little was known about mercury even the best telescopic views from earth showed mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail the planet is so close to the sun that it is usually lost in solar glare when the planet is visible on earths horizon just after sunset or before dawn it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere only radar telescopes gave any hint of mercurys surface conditions prior to the voyage of mariner 10       the photographs mariner 10 radioed back to earth revealed an ancient heavily cratered surface closely resembling our own moon the pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet these apparently were created when mercurys interior cooled and shrank buckling the planets crust the cliffs are as high as 3 kilometers 2 miles and as long as 500 kilometers 310 miles       instruments on mariner 10 discovered that mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere  a trillionth the density of earths atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon neon and helium when the planets orbit takes it closest to the sun surface temperatures range from 467 degrees celsius 872 degrees fahrenheit on mercurys sunlit side to 183 degrees celsius 298 degrees fahrenheit on the dark side this range in surface temperature  650 degrees celsius 1170 degrees fahrenheit  is the largest for a single body in the solar system mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time       days and nights are long on mercury the combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars 59 earth days and a rapid revolution around the sun 88 earth days means that one mercury solar day takes 176 earth days or two mercury years  the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the sun        mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of earth scientists believe mercury has a heavy ironrich core making up slightly less than half of its volume that would make mercurys core larger proportionally than the moons core or those of any of the planets       after the initial mercury encounter mariner 10 made two additional flybys  on september 21 1974 and march 16 1975  before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded each flyby took place at the same local mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated as a result we still have not seen onehalf of the planets surface        venus       veiled by dense cloud cover venus  our nearest planetary neighbor  was the first planet to be explored the mariner 2 spacecraft launched on august 27 1962 was the first of more than a dozen successful american and soviet missions to study the mysterious planet as spacecraft flew by or orbited venus plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on venus surface romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest       on december 14 1962 mariner 2 passed within 34839 kilometers 21648 miles of venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet onboard instruments measured venus for 42 minutes mariner 5 launched in june 1967 flew much closer to the planet passing within 4094 kilometers 2544 miles of venus on the second american flyby mariner 5s instruments measured the planets magnetic field ionosphere radiation belts and temperatures on its way to mercury mariner 10 flew by venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the venusian atmosphere       in the spring and summer of 1978 two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of venus on december 4 of the same year the pioneer venus orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet       five days later the five separate components making up the second spacecraft  the pioneer venus multiprobe  entered the venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet the four small independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to earth during their descent toward the surface although designed to examine the atmosphere one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour       venus resembles earth in size physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet however spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well for example venus rotation west to east is retrograde backward compared to the easttowest spin of earth and most of the other planets       approximately 965 percent of venus atmosphere 95 times as dense as earths is carbon dioxide the principal constituent of earths atmosphere is nitrogen venus atmosphere acts like a greenhouse permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space as a result the planets average surface temperature is 482 degrees celsius 900 degrees fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead       a radio altimeter on the pioneer venus orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planets dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet nasas magellan spacecraft launched on may 5 1989 has been in orbit around venus since august 10 1990 the spacecraft uses radarmapping techniques to provide ultrahighresolution images of the surface       magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features faults and impact craters huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones an elevated region named ishtar terra is a lavafilled basin as large as the united states at one end of this plateau sits maxwell montes a mountain the size of mount everest scarring the mountains flank is a 100kilometer 62mile wide 25kilometer 15mile deep impact crater named cleopatra almost all features on venus are named for women maxwell montes alpha regio and beta regio are the exceptions craters survive on venus for perhaps 400 million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion       extensive faultline networks cover the planet probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on earth but on venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock which cracks just about everywhere preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the san andreas fault in california       venus predominant weather pattern is a highaltitude highspeed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid at speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers 225 miles per hour the clouds circle the planet in only four earth days the circulation is in the same direction  west to east  as venus slow rotation of 243 earth days whereas earths winds blow in both directions  west to east and east to west  in six alternating bands venus atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather        earth       as viewed from space our worlds distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters brown and green land masses and white clouds we are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of 78 percent nitrogen 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life earth orbits the sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometers 93 million miles earth is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of venus       our planets rapid spin and molten nickeliron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field which along with the atmosphere shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the sun and other stars earths atmosphere protects us from meteors as well most of which burn up before they can strike the surface active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting earth almost certainly received soon after it formed  about 46 billion years ago along with the other newly formed planets it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system       from our journeys into space we have learned much about our home planet the first american satellite  explorer 1  was launched from cape canaveral in florida on january 31 1958 and discovered an intense radiation zone now called the van allen radiation belts surrounding earth       since then other research satellites have revealed that our planets magnetic field is distorted into a teardrop shape by the solar wind  the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the sun weve learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries and we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere once believed calm and uneventful seethes with activity  swelling by day and contracting by night affected by changes in solar activity the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on earth       besides affecting earths weather solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere when charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in earths magnetic field they collide with air molecules above our planets magnetic poles these air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights       satellites about 35789 kilometers 22238 miles out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting these watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of earths complex weather systems       from their unique vantage points satellites can survey earths oceans land use and resources and monitor the planets health these eyes in space have saved countless lives provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways        the moon       the moon is earths single natural satellite the first human footsteps on an alien world were made by american astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless lifeless companion in preparation for the humancrewed apollo expeditions nasa dispatched the automated ranger surveyor and lunar orbiter spacecraft to study the moon between 1964 and 1968       nasas apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data six twoastronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972 carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms 842 pounds and consisting of more than 2000 separate samples       from this material and other studies scientists have constructed a history of the moon that includes its infancy rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4043 billion years old the first few million years of the moons existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain as a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock the moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects some of the asteroids were as large as rhode island or delaware and their collisions with the moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across       this catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the moon at depths of about 200 kilometers 125 miles below the surface then for the next 700 million years  from about 38 to 31 billion years ago  lava rose from inside the moon the lava gradually spread out over the surface flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that galileo galilei an astronomer of the italian renaissance called maria meaning seas       as far as we can tell there has been no significant volcanic activity on the moon for more than three billion years since then the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites by the atomic particles from the sun and stars by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts if our astronauts had landed on the moon a billion years ago they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today thousands of years from now the footsteps left by the apollo crews will remain sharp and clear       the origin of the moon is still a mystery four theories attempt an explanation the moon formed near earth as a separate body it was torn from earth it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planets gravity or it was the result of a collision between earth and an asteroid about the size of mars the last theory has some good support but is far from certain        mars       of all the planets mars has long been considered the solar systems prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface these observations  later determined to be optical illusions  led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet in 1938 when orson welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic war of the worlds  by hg wells enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic       another reason for scientists to expect life on mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planets surface this phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods       so far six american missions to mars have been carried out four mariner spacecraft  three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit  surveyed the planet extensively before the viking orbiters and landers arrived       mariner 4 launched in late 1964 flew past mars on july 14 1965 coming within 9846 kilometers 6118 miles of the surface transmitting to earth 22 closeup pictures of the planet the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of 1969 and returned 201 pictures mariners 4 6 and 7 showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin cold dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide       on may 30 1971 the mariner 9 orbiter was launched on a mission to make a yearlong study of the martian surface the spacecraft arrived five and a half months after liftoff only to find mars in the midst of a planetwide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks but after the storm cleared mariner 9 began returning the first of 7329 pictures these revealed previously unknown martian features including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface etching river valleys and flood plains       in august and september 1975 the viking 1 and 2 spacecraft  each consisting of an orbiter and a lander  lifted off from kennedy space center the mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet including is there life there nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the viking landers would at least find evidence of primitive life  past or present       viking lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on july 20 1976 while the united states was celebrating its bicentennial photos sent back from the chryse planitia plains of gold showed a bleak rustyred landscape panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue when viking lander 2 touched down on utopia planitia on september 3 1976 it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor  one without visible dunes       the results sent back by the laboratory on each viking lander were inconclusive small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes while some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planets soil chemistry is there life on mars no one knows for sure but the viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there       the viking landers became weather stations recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure few weather changes were observed the highest temperature recorded by either craft was 14 degrees celsius 7 degrees fahrenheit at the viking lander 1 site in midsummer       the lowest temperature 120 degrees celsius 184 degrees fahrenheit was recorded at the more northerly viking lander 2 site during winter nearhurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms but because the atmosphere is so thin wind force is minimal viking lander 2 photographed light patches of frost  probably waterice  during its second winter on the planet       the martian atmosphere like that of venus is primarily carbon dioxide nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages martian air contains only about 11000 as much water as our air but even this small amount can condense out forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys       there is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet physical features closely resembling shorelines gorges riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet       mars has two moons phobos and deimos they are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient cratered surfaces it is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to mars and were captured by its gravity       the viking orbiters and landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days respectively the first to fail was viking orbiter 2 which stopped operating on july 24 1978 when a leak depleted its attitudecontrol gas viking lander 2 operated until april 12 1980 when it was shut down because of battery degeneration viking orbiter 1 quit on august 7 1980 when the last of its attitudecontrol gas was used up viking lander 1 ceased functioning on november 13 1983       despite the inconclusive results of the viking biology experiments we know more about mars than any other planet except earth nasas mars observer spacecraft to be launched in september 1992 will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet         asteroids       the solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the sun but are too small to be considered fullfledged planets these objects are known as asteroids or minor planets most but not all are found in a band or belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter some have orbits that cross earths path and there is evidence that earth has been hit by asteroids in the past one of the least eroded best preserved examples is the barringer meteor crater near winslow arizona       asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system one theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago more likely asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet in fact if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object the object would be only about 1500 kilometers 932 miles across  less than half the diameter of our moon        thousands of asteroids have been identified from earth it is estimated that 100000 are bright enough to eventually be photographed through earthbased telescopes       much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of earth asteroids that are on a collision course with earth are called meteoroids when a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor if the meteoroid does not burn up completely whats left strikes earths surface and is called a meteorite one of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of antarctica       of all the meteorites examined 928 percent are composed of silicate stone and 57 percent are composed of iron and nickel the rest are a mixture of the three materials stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks       since asteroids are material from the very early solar system scientists are interested in their composition spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances       current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination the galileo orbiter launched by nasa in october 1989 will investigate mainbelt asteroids on its way to jupiter the comet rendezvousasteroid flyby craf and cassini missions will also study these farflung objects scheduled for launch in the latter part of the 1990s the craf and cassini missions are a collaborative project of nasa the european space agency and the federal space agencies of germany and italy as well as the united states air force and the department of energy one day space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials        jupiter       beyond mars and the asteroid belt in the outer regions of our solar system lie the giant planets of jupiter saturn uranus and neptune in 1972 nasa dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock jupiter was the first port of call       pioneer 10 which lifted off from kennedy space center in march 1972 was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system in december 1973 it returned the first closeup images of jupiter flying within 132252 kilometers 82178 miles of the planets banded cloud tops pioneer 11 followed a year later voyagers 1 and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned spectacular photographs of jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in 1979       these travelers found jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium ammonia ice crystals form white jovian clouds sulfur compounds and perhaps phosphorus may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize jupiters atmosphere       it is likely that methane ammonia water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planets frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below because of jupiters atmospheric dynamics however these organic compounds  if they exist  are probably shortlived       the great red spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on earth this hurricanelike storm in jupiters atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet as a highpressure region the great red spot spins in a direction opposite to that of lowpressure storms on jupiter it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it the great red spot might be a million years old       our spacecraft detected lightning in jupiters upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to earths northern lights at the jovian polar regions voyager 1 returned the first images of a faint narrow ring encircling jupiter       largest of the solar systems planets jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace  once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds the massive planet takes almost 12 earth years to complete a journey around the sun with 16 known moons jupiter is something of a miniature solar system       a new mission to jupiter  the galileo project  is under way after a six year cruise that takes the galileo orbiter once past venus twice past earth and the moon and once past two asteroids the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into jupiters cloud layers and relay data back to earth the galileo orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to jupiters large moons exploring in detail what the two pioneers and two voyagers revealed        galilean satellites       in 1610 galileo galilei aimed his telescope at jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet for the first time humans had seen the moons of another world in honor of their discoverer these four bodies would become known as the galilean satellites or moons but galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planetsized satellites       one of the most remarkable findings of the voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the galilean moon io volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than earth the voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on io with plumes of ejected material extending as far as 280 kilometers 175 miles above the moons surface       ios pizzacolored terrain marked by orange and yellow hues is probably the result of sulfurrich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tugofwar between io jupiter and the other three galilean moons       europa approximately the same size as our moon is the brightest galilean satellite the moons surface displays a complex array of streaks indicating the crust has been fractured caught in a gravitational tugofwar like io europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt  apparently producing a liquidwater ocean this ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space europas core is made of rock that sank to its center       like europa the other two galilean moons  ganymede and callisto  are worlds of ice and rock ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system  larger than the planets mercury and pluto the satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock ganymedes surface has areas of different brightness indicating that in the past material oozed out of the moons interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface       callisto only slightly smaller than ganymede has the lowest density of any galilean satellite suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts       detailed studies of all the galilean satellites will be performed by the galileo orbiter        saturn       no planet in the solar system is adorned like saturn its exquisite ring system is unrivaled like jupiter saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen but in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in jovian clouds saturns atmosphere has a more subtle butterscotch hue and its markings are muted by highaltitude haze given saturns somewhat placidlooking appearance scientists were surprised at the highvelocity equatorial jet stream that blows some 1770 kilometers 1100 miles per hour       three american spacecraft have visited saturn pioneer 11 sped by the planet and its moon titan in september 1979 returning the first closeup images voyager 1 followed in november 1980 sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of saturns ring system and moons voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in august 1981       the rings are composed of countless lowdensity particles orbiting individually around saturns equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size ranging from dust to housesized boulders the rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock       the rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to saturn the unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of saturns gravity a third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet       unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of saturn and its satellites these complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings       radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an am car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the voyager spacecraft these emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from saturns ring system rather than its atmosphere where no lightning was observed as they had at jupiter the voyagers saw a version of earths auroras near saturns poles       the voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit we learned that some moons shepherd ring particles maintaining saturns rings and the gaps in the rings saturns 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from images taken by voyager 2 in 1981        voyager 1 determined that titan has a nitrogenbased atmosphere with methane and argon  one more like earths in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of mars and venus titans surface temperature of 179 degrees celsius 290 degrees fahrenheit implies that there might be waterice islands rising above oceans of ethanemethane liquid or sludge unfortunately voyagers cameras could not penetrate the moons dense clouds       continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting titans methane to ethane acetylene and  in combination with nitrogen  hydrogen cyanide the latter compound is a building block of amino acids these conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval earth between three and four billion years ago however titans atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry       the exploration of saturn will continue with the cassini mission the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called huygens which will be dropped into titans atmosphere and fall to the surface cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through titans clouds and will spend years examining the saturnian system        uranus       in january 1986 four and a half years after visiting saturn voyager 2 completed the first closeup survey of the uranian system the brief flyby revealed more information about uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planets discovery over two centuries ago by the english astronomer william herschel       uranus third largest of the planets is an oddball of the solar system unlike the other planets with the exception of pluto this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84year swing around the solar system during voyager 2s flyby the south pole faced the sun uranus might have been knocked over when an earthsized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system       voyager 2 found that uranus magnetic field does not follow the usual northsouth axis found on the other planets instead the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planets center a phenomenon that on earth would be like having one magnetic pole in new york city and the other in the city of djakarta on the island of java in indonesia       uranus atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen with some 12 percent helium and small amounts of ammonia methane and water vapor the planets blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors wind speeds range up to 580 kilometers 360 miles per hour and temperatures near the cloud tops average 221 degrees celsius 366 degrees fahrenheit       uranus sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical smog believed to be a combination of acetylene ethane and other sunlightgenerated chemicals surrounding the planets atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as electroglow       approximately 8000 kilometers 5000 miles below uranus cloud tops there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 10000 kilometers 6200 miles deep beneath this ocean is an earthsized core of heavier materials       voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons 16169 kilometers 10105 miles in diameter orbiting uranus the five previously known  miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon  range in size from 520 to 1610 kilometers 323 to 1000 miles across representing a geological showcase these five moons are halfice halfrock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity including faulting and ice flows       the most remarkable of uranus moons is miranda its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons craterpocked plains and winding valleys the sharp variations in terrain suggest that after the moon formed it was smashed apart by a collision with another body  an event not unusual in our solar system which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts what is extraordinary is that miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface       uranus was thought to have nine dark rings voyager 2 imaged 11 in contrast to saturns rings which are composed of bright particles uranus rings are primarily made up of dark bouldersized chunks        neptune       voyager 2 completed its 12year tour of the solar system with an investigation of neptune and the planets moons on august 25 1989 the spacecraft swept to within 4850 kilometers 3010 miles of neptune and then flew on to the moon triton during the neptune encounter it became clear that the planets atmosphere was more active than uranus        voyager 2 observed the great dark spot a circular storm the size of earth in neptunes atmosphere resembling jupiters great red spot the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost 1200 kilometers 745 miles per hour voyager 2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fastmoving cloud dubbed the scooter as well as highaltitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck the highest wind speeds of any planet were observed up to 2400 kilometers 1500 miles per hour       like the other giant planets neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior the planets core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants neptunes distinctive blue appearance like uranus blue color is due to atmospheric methane       neptunes magnetic field is tilted relative to the planets spin axis and is not centered at the core this phenomenon is similar to uranus magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal earths magnetic field on the other hand is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center       voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of neptunes rings observations from earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet it was not clear how neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even unclumped rings voyager 2 detected these arcs but they were in fact part of thin complete rings a number of small moons could explain the arcs but such bodies were not spotted       astronomers had identified the neptunian moons triton in 1846 and nereid in 1949 voyager 2 found six more one of the new moons  proteus  is actually larger than nereid but since proteus orbits close to neptune it was lost in the planets glare for observers on earth        triton circles neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days tidal forces on triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet in 10 to 100 million years a short time in astronomical terms the moon will be so close that neptunian gravity will tear it apart forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planets modest current rings       tritons landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of io and miranda the moon has more rock than its counterparts at saturn and uranus tritons mantle is probably composed of waterice but the moons crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane the moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain the socalled cantaloupe terrain and a receding ice cap        dark streaks appear on the ice cap these streaks are the fallout from geyserlike volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark finegrained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers 1 to 5 miles tritons thin atmosphere only 170000th as thick as earths has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap  the coldest surface yet found in the solar system 235 degrees celsius 391 degrees fahrenheit triton might be more like pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited        pluto       pluto is the most distant of the planets yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside neptunes orbit where it has been since 1979 and where it will remain until march 1999 plutos orbit is also highly inclined  tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets       discovered in 1930 pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball the planets diameter is calculated to be approximately 2300 kilometers 1430 miles only twothirds the size of our moon groundbased observations indicate that plutos surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the sun observations also show that plutos spin axis is tipped by 122 degrees        the planet has one known satellite charon discovered in 1978 charons surface composition is different from plutos the moon appears to be covered with waterice rather than methane ice its orbit is gravitationally locked with pluto so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other plutos and charons rotational period and charons period of revolution are all 64 earth days        although no spacecraft have ever visited pluto nasa is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission        comets       the outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets as asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the sun most comet nuclei reside in the oort cloud a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star       comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the sun as a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets these volatile elements are boiling the nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across and is made principally of waterice with methane and ammonia  materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets       as these materials boil off of the nucleus they form a coma or cloudlike head that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across the coma grows as the comet gets closer to the sun the stream of charged particles coming from the sun pushes on this cloud blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comets tails gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus but dust particles are pushed more slowly as the nucleus continues in its orbit the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc       both the gas and dust tails point away from the sun in effect the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the sun the tails can reach 150 million kilometers 93 million miles in length but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase comets  from the latin cometa meaning longhaired  are essentially dramatic light shows       some comets pass through the solar system only once but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets these latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system       halleys comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet returning on an average of once every 76 years and orbiting from beyond neptune to within venus orbit confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 bc this regular visitor to our solar system is named for sir edmond halley because he plotted the comets orbit and predicted its return based on earlier sightings and newtonian laws of motion his name became part of astronomical lore when in 1759 the comet returned on schedule unfortunately sir edmond did not live to see it       a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to earth unfortunately on its most recent appearance halleys comet passed no closer than 624 million kilometers 388 million miles from our world the comet was visible to the naked eye especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere but it was not spectacular comets have been so bright on rare occasions that they were visible during daytime historically comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky       the comet rendezvousasteroid flyby craf spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the sun craf will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed the first was nasas international cometary explorer in 1985 an armada of five spacecraft two japanese two soviet and the giotto spacecraft from the european space agency flew by halleys comet in 1986        conclusion       despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely  earth but since 1959 spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space        we have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years our automated spacecraft have traveled to the moon and to all the planets beyond our world except pluto they have observed moons as large as small planets flown by comets and sampled the solar environment astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations we are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects       the knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology by studying the geology of planets moons asteroids and comets and comparing differences and similarities we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole       we are also gaining insight into earths complex weather systems by seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the suns activity and its influence throughout the solar system we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on earth       we will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space one current mission is mapping venus others are flying between worlds and will reach the sun and jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments future missions are planned for mars saturn a comet and the asteroid belt       we can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world although astronauts have not been back to the moon since december 1972 plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of mars and even the establishment of martian outposts one day taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a lunar base or a martian colony   end        ,2

c5vgydh7sacsubuffaloedu psyrobtwubvmsdccbuffaloedu robert weiss writes in article 93111074840librbabyuvmbitnet librbabyuvmbitnet writes  rick anderson writes  ra   robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying ra things like it is held that cf kermit thread  on what ra exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox       orthodox is a compound word it comes from orthos straight true       right and from doxa opinion doctrine teaching i use orthodox to       refer to right teaching     as opposed to universal or catholic or foursquare gosple i think that    the greek orthodox church would take high offense at your misuse of the    word your version of christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived    you make claims of biblecentricity that are not derivable soley from the    bible  about sixseven months ago you claimed that your primary objection    to the lds was that our doctrine was not biblederived and now this    and other claims can be shown are also not bible interpeting bible                                     right teaching is derived from letting god       speak to us through the bible this can be from reading simple truths       in the scriptures and by using the bible to interpret the bible  9simple truths oh for example     ra who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant       i think that it is apparent from reading the scriptures that are      pertinent       luke 2343 records christs promise to the repentant thief who hung on      an adjacent cross truly i say to you today you will be with me in      paradise but was it not until later that christ rose from the dead      and ascended to heaven if christ himself was not in heaven until      sunday how could the repentant thief have been there with him the      answer lies in the location of paradise when jesus died       apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until easter day          paradise exalted to heaven  9paradise wasnt equal to heaven and now it is yet you claim that  9peeple can not be exalted to heaven nicht wahr        jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and       lazarus as abrahams bosom to which the godly beggar lazarus was      carried by the angels after his decease luke 161931  thus      abrahams bosom referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed      waited till the day of christs resurrection  9when i read the story i found that  abrahams bosom wasnt so much 9a place but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to abraham       it was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of       hades hebrew sheol reserved for believers who had died in the faith      but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of god in heaven      until the price of redemption had actually been paid on calvary or      even that none would precede the presence of jesus back to glory with      the father  9gee this is fairly close to what the lds call spirit prison and what         you have called false doctrine       doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of jesus and the      repentant thief repaired after they each died on friday afternoon but      on sunday after the risen christ had first appeared to mary magdalene      john 2017 and her two companions matthew 289 presumably he then      took up with him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise      including abraham lazarus and the repentant thief we read in      ephesians 48 concerning christ ascending on high he led captivity      captive he gave gifts unto men        vers deleted reproduced below quoted from the sunspot gopher archive                                                  presumably he led the whole      band of liberated captives from hades ie the whole population of      preresurrection paradise up to the glory of heaven     this part is not supported from scripture nor does it support your    claim that the paradise where christ descended was exalted     making such claims on this little evidence ignores the witness of the    scripture  sunephas sun 48 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity sun captive and gave gifts unto men sun  sun xref psalms 6818 sun  thou has ascended on hight thout hast led captivity captive thou has sun  recieved gifts for men yea for the rebellious aslo that the lord god sun  might dwell amoung them sun sunephas sun 49 now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first sun into the lower parts of the earth  410 he that descended is the same sun also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all sun things  411 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and sun some evangelists and some pastors and teachers 412 for the sun perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the sun edifying of the body of christ 413 till we all come in the unity of sun the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man sun unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ 414 that we sun henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about sun with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning sun craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive 415 but speaking the sun truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head     using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison is now changed from    a preeaster postion to posteaster by god postion is not supportable      makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here    ra whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is ra challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ra look at the bible in order to see the truth but what of those who ra see biblical things differently from you       i think that this characterization is faulty whenever my personal       interpretation is questioned i usually give a reason    yes and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading   of the scriptures you have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural    proof need to be crosschecked the referencs that you supply often do   not support your postion if they are read in the context of the scripture         as for those that see things differently please put forward where      there is a valid difference and we can discuss it        i seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one       views the bible is somehow legitimate except or course for the stuff       that i glean from it put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can       have a discussion on that topic but to decry something that i put       forward without putting forward something else to discuss and to       dismiss what i put forward while giving credence to other alleged views      that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious  9how about that those who have been in paradise and have accepted 9the gosple will be judged of jesus christ and then return to the 9presence of god is that somehow different from your expressed view 9that the paradise spoken of or abrahams bosom  ra are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really ra understands it       if you believe that something that i have drawn from scripture is       wrong then please show me from scripture where it is wrong  simply       stating that there are other views is not a proof show it to me from       scripture and then we can go on  9should we go back and discuss your view on why the angle of the lord 9is the lord again

142  andrew newell tan102psuvmpsuedu wrote    i think youre letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of   webster  myth  a traditional or legendary story             a beliefwhose truth is accepted uncritically   how does that qualify  indeed its almost oxymoronica rather amusing instance  ive found that most atheists hold almost no atheistviews as  accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend  many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but  they dont meet the other criterions  andrew  the myth to which i refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have created to make religion appear absurd rather than approach religion including christainity in a rational manner and debating its claims as the are stated atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then hold the religious accountable for beliefs they dont have what is more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist  bill   divine justice according to the most fundamental doctrines of  christianity when the first man sinned he was at that time the   you accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to  launch your own xtian mythology  this time meeting all the  requirements of myth   heres a good example of of what i said above read the post again i said acoording to  which means i am referring to christian doctrine as i understand it if i am speaking for myself youll know it my purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of christain doctrines since it seemed germane  bill   with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it  means when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and  dont know what he wants they contradict the bible which clearly says  that everyone knows the authority of the bible is its claim to be   should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting  it across  you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesnt  make it any more credible to me  if the bible says that everyone knows thats clearly reason  to doubt the bible because not everyone knows your alleged  gods alleged existance  again i am paraphrasing christian doctrine which is very clear on this point your dispute is not with me   bill   refuted while the specieswide condemnation is justified those that  claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is  unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is  no excuse   1 no they dont have to ignore the bible  the bible is far  from universally accepted  the bible is not a proof of god  it is only a proof that some people have thought that there  was a god  or does it prove even that  they might have been  writing it as series of fiction shortstories  as in the  case of dionetics  assuming the writers believed it the  only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it  and thats ignoring the problem of whether or not all the  interpretations and biblicalphilosophers were correct   2 there are people who have truly never heard of the bible   3 again read the faq  1 here again you miss the point the bible itself is not the point its what it contains it makes no difference who accpets the bible or even whos unaware of its existence christians hold that it applies universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of god  2 see above  3 if you read my post with same care as read the faq we wouldnt be having this conversation  bill   freedom you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to  ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known  in both cases that an atheist cant accept the evidence means only   bzztwrong answer  gravity is directly there  it doesnt stop exerting a direct and  rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it  god on the  other hand doesnt generally show up in the supermarket except  on the tabloids  god doesnt exert a rationally undeniable influence  gravity is obvious gods arent  as i said the evidence is there you just dont accept it here at least we agree  bill   secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god so  much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason  always comes back to the question of god in every generation and in   no human reason hasnt always come back to the existance of  god it has usually come back to the existance of god  in other words it doesnt generally come back to the xtian  god it comes back to whether there is any god  and in much  of oriental philosophic history it generally doesnt pop up as  the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces  are and which ones are out there  from a worldwide view  human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to  be andor what forces are currently in control  a natural  tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful  thinking  yes human reason does always come back to the existence of god were having this discussion are we not  bill   i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently  reasonable that divine justice is just and human nature is much  different than what atheists think it is whether you agree or not   you certainly are not correct on human nature  you are at  the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric  approach  try looking at the outside world as well when  you attempt to sum up all of humanity  well this is interesting truth is to be determined by it politically correct content granted its extremely unhip to be a wasp male and anything european is contemptable but i thought this kind of dialogue the purpose of aa was to get at the truth of things but then i remember the oxymoron reasonalble atheist and i understand  bill ,0

consider it rape    of course not i would think that would be great fun not having ever felt the joy and peace the christians speak of with a longing gaze this is not what i got when i believed  i just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something i never was sure of the bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure god did not answer in the end i found i had been following a mass delusion a lie i cant believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence   obviously there are many christians who have tried and do believe so    i suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position in fact it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite  one should not examine ones belief critically  ill tell you something i left out of my testimony i posted to this group two months ago a day after i finally found out my faith is over i decided to try just one more time the same cycle of emotional responses fired once again but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours i told my friend in a phone that it really works thank god just to think about it again when i hung up i had to admit that i had lied and fallen prey to the same illusion   no one asks you to swallow everything in fact jesus warns against it   but let  me ask you a question  do you beleive what you learn in history class or for  that matter anything in school  i mean its just what other people have told  you and you dont want to swallow what others say right    i used to believe what i read in books when i was younger or what other people told me but i grew more and more skeptical the more i read i learned what it means to use reason  as a student of chemistry i had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab i hated experiments like this  they are oldfashioned and increase the students workload considerably besides i had to do it twice since i failed in my first attempt however i think ill never forget the lesson   no matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is x it may still be y it is very tempting to jump into conclusions take a leap of faith assure oneself ignore the data which is inconsistent  but it can still be wrong   i found out that i was after all using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god  mental selfassurance suspension of fear  filtering of information in other words it was only me no god playing any part    the life  death and resurection of christ is documented historical fact  oh and i had better believe this dan many ufo stories are much better documented than the resurrection of jesus the resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the bible  it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out besides the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions for instance the end of mark 16920 is missing from many early texts says my bible  jesus may have lived and died but he was probably misunderstood   as much  as anything else you learn  how do you choose what to believe and   what not to  this is easy i believe that the world exists independent of my mind and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what i observe nothing else need to be taken on faith i will go by the evidence   it makes no difference whether i believe george washington existed or not i assume that he did considering the vast amount of evidence presented   there is no way to get into a sceptical heart  you can not say you have   given a   sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have  you must trust   not just go   to church and participate in its activities  were you ever willing to  die for what you believed    a liar how do you know what my attitude was try reading your bible again   i was willing to die for my faith those who do are usually remembered as heroes at least among those who believe dan do you think im lying when i say i believed firmly for 15 years it seems it is  very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore but i cant go on lying to myself  blind trust is dangerous and i was just another blind led by the blind but if god really wants me shell know what to do im willing i just dont know whether she exists

277,277,from brianlplarizonaedu brian ceccarelli 6026219615 subject re is it good that jesus died organization lunar  planetary laboratory tucson az lines 192  brian kendig first states   i am my own master  i ask   are you truly the master of yourself  brian kendig states   not yet     make up your mind        but my life is the ground i use to practice on  the fun is  in the getting there we dont start out perfect      and we do not end perfect either  we are never perfect  can you name one person young or old past or present that you deem perfect  good luck   i know my shortcomings and i know my strengths and i live  my life according to the decisions i make and i am content to abide  with the consequences of my decisions as easily as ill accept the  praise for them  there have been times in my life when ive made  mistakes yes i try to never make the same mistake twice  then you lie to yourself  you do not know your shortcomings  i have clearly shown one of your shortcomings if not two  that is ignorance of the bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its  contents   i regard christ as a myth   because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself and to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion i bet you do not even know what the word christ means  or which prophet used christ to  describe the son of man    i feel that there are far too many people  offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and  did  the only person who can really judge me is me  yes  i agree with that  so we must learn first  read the bible  come up with our own interpretation   evaluate what is being said and by whom  check the history books as well  compare someone elses interpretation with your own  then make a judgment  but i tell you the truth 99 of what is being said in the bible needs interpretation as  much as a coffee cup needs interpretation  and remember the bible isnt a gurus esoteric guide to metaphysics   it doesnt take a theologian to understand what is being said    the  bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and i addressed  to people like you and i  these guys wrote down what they saw and heard  is it  their open diaryand they want to tell you something  and because they want you to know something they make it very clear what they want you to know   they didnt encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric but in simple straightforward language   i choose the  roads i travel and i decide whether or not i want to reach the end of  any given road or turn back  and as long as i dont always turn  back theres no shame in it  when i need help i seek out my friends  you have chosen the road that avoids the bible  you have chosen the road that avoids a confrontation with the living god because that road doesnt look appealing to you  you rather build your own road  one that goes far away from that confrontation   but be assured of this you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly   and you dont have a clue about what im saying either  open your eyes and see open your ears and listen  im not just spouting off empty words  this is my life this is what gives me meaning  i see what you mean  i hear what your saying  i am not degrading your life  but i have heard the same irrational excuses for years  there is nothing  new in what you are saying  and by your own words you are spouting off  contradictions   if contradictions give you meaning then your life must be sad   i say my mother loves me  how do i know you ask  i can point to  definite things shes done for me and i can even just bring her to  you so you can ask her facetoface  you say your deity loves you  how do you know i ask   bingo  for god so loved the world he gave his only begotton to son so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life   i look what god did  he has given his son even to his death so that i can have  hope in his resurrection and know that life isnt for nothing but has glorious purpose   you cant even convince me that it exists   because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history  you choose to lie to yourself that he doesnt exist for you ignore what has been said for  thousands of years  you sound exactly almost verbatim like the lazarus of  jesuss story starting in luke 1619  and the conclusion of that story is a  bleak one  lazarus wound up in hell  the story ends like this        for if lazarus doesnt even listen to moses and the prophets        he wont even believe if a man rose from the dead   if any god dangles heaven before me like a carrot promising untold  pleasures to me if ill only suspend my disbelief and ignore my  rationality for just this once then i would choose hell  i can  not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful  it is  arrogance at its best   the fact is you are not rational  several specific cases  have already been cited   and again with this new statement you show more irrationality with regards to heaven  jesus does tell you something of what to expect in heaven  jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him  jesus does not expect you to placate either  jesus wants you to willingly come to him but not as his grovelling slave but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious riches  why do you not pick up the bible and read it for yourself   you maintain you have an open mind  see whether you are lying to yourself for yourself  why would you want to live a good life to you you die and thats it  dont contradict yourself  you have no reason to live a good life  it doesnt do you any good in the end  your life doesnt do anybody else any good  either because everyone dies anyway  so you have no reason to lead a good life leading a good life is meaningless   why do you do such a meaningless thing  that paragraph demonstrates that you havent listened to a single word ive said  i do understand what you said   but thats is not what i feel went amiss here  you missed the point  living a good life has no eternal consequences once they close the amusement park of life to you that is the end  to you it  is over  to you therefore your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless  it has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth   but then you contradict yourself  from a previous post you said doing evil things  is bad  to you it shouldnt matter if you do evil things or good things  it is all meaningless in the end anyway  so go rob a bank  go tell someone you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag  whats restraining you life after all has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant   in the same way i think life is fun  and i dont intend to leave the  amusement park of life until they close down for the night  d  at which time you are truly not the master of yourself  im sorry i dont feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god id worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case its not really all that important  has the resurrection sunk in  jesus is alive  jesus is not dead  so you and your holy book say  by the same token therefore santa claus delivers toys every xmas  dont you see  i have no reason to believe that what you say is true  please give me some reason that i cant similarly apply to santa claus  you have every reason to believe that what jesus says and the witnesses of jesus say are true  but you choose to be unreasonable and ignore the reasons  by definition ignorance   santa claus is said to live at the north pole and have a squad of elves and flying reindeer   ever see a flying reindeer  has anyone in human history seen a flying reindeer  has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose  blinks red      on the other hand are people born in bethlehem  was nebuchandezzar really a king  was daniel really one of his court officials  were david and solomon really kings of israel and judah  was their really a king called jehoachin did sennecherib really attack jerusalem 600 years before christ  did sennacherib really lose his battleand badly   was there really a  caiaphas who interrogated jesus   yes yes yes    history verifies it  it is nonfiction  do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction  perhaps you cant evaluate the context of grimms fairy tales apart from that of the scientific american  i suppose you treat both with equal truthfulness or equal falsity  is this what you are telling me  or is it that just do want to read the scientific american and find out that its not a fairy tale  are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a collection of verses in a book and cannot be supported without invoking them  get real  have you ever been to zaire  do you have to go there to be  assured that there really is such a place  given your  irrationality i take it you have never used a map in your life   why do you believe what you believe  given the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living god id be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if i didnt follow jesus ,3

1r4e63inn2kbowlcsrvuidahoedu lanphi872moscowuidahoedu rob lanphier writes   these are two conflicting statements  to say one is a clarification of the  other is a breach of logic  i dont mind people shifting their position on  an issue  it irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change  was made  what about deuteronomy 222025  is it wrong now  did jesus  change that     if anything he clarified the law such as in that quote you made  in the   following verses jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon   the law giving clearer meaning to what god intended    sure he does this  however he doesnt address the notion of stoning  nonvirgin brides because this needs no clarification  are you going to  deny that deuteronomy 222025 is not patently clear in its intent   i see what you are getting at or at least i think i do  correct me if i am mistaken but i think you are asking me if i still believe that we should uphold all of the laws pertaining to capital punishment for such things as adultery rape and other heinous crimes  as you may recall jesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress who was caught in the act and brought before jesus  and his reply let he who is without sin cast the first stone  jesus does not deny the sentence that is to due for this violation of the law  what do you think of this      i think you will agree with me that there are in todays world a lot of   modernday pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe   in it  what good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart    ill agree that there is a lot of modern day pharisees that know the bible  from end to end and dont believe in it  depending on how they use this  knowledge they can be scary  they can argue any position they desire and  back it up with selected parts of the bible  such pharisees include david  koresh and adolph hitler  i will qualify this by saying i dont know if  they actually believed what they were preaching but the ends certainly  made the means look frightening   agreed      however just as scary are those that dont know much of the bible but  believe every word  in fact this is probably scarier since there are far  more of these people from what ive seen  in addition they are very easy  to manipulate by the aforementioned pharisees since they dont know enough  to debate with these people    agreed also  if one is to use the bible as a reference one must always be open to different interpretations  as a christian i have the spirit of god to verify what i believe in the word  if what the spirit tells me is not backed up in scripture then the spirit i am communicating with is not of god  after all jesus tells us to test the spirits to know for sure that it is from god     christianity is not just a set of rules its a lifestyle that changes ones   perspectives and personal conduct  and it demands obedience to gods will    no it demands obedience to a book  if god came down and personally told  me how i should behave then i would say that i would be doing gods will  by doing it  however if preachers pastors and evangelists tell me to  obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to  two millenia even longer for the ot even if i follow everything in it  with my heart i could scarcely be honest with myself by saying im doing  the will of god   i obey what the spirit of god tells me to do  the spirit will not violate anything that is written in the bible because that is the word of god  i do not worship pastors preachers my wife my mother or my father  what they tell me does not carry the weight of what god tells me to do and his commands are rienforced in the bible     some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not  that is   their choice and i have to respect it because god respects it too    well if god respects it so much how come there is talk in the bible about  eternal damnation for nonbelievers  i see little respect eminating from  the god of the bible  i see a selfish and spiteful god   eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting god  if you choose to jump off a cliff you can hardly blame god for you  going splat at the bottom  he knows that if you choose to jump that  you will die but he will not prevent you from making that choice  in fact he sent his son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what lies below  to prove that point jesus took that plunge himself but he being god was able to rise up again  i have seen the example of christ and have  chosen not to jump and im trying to tell you not to jump or else youll  go splat   you dont have to listen to me and i wont stop you if you decide to jump i only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge  you owe it to yourself  i dont like seeing anyone go splat  god be with you   malcolm lee   ,3

316,316,from graemelabtamlabtamozau graeme gill subject re gamma correction organization labtam australia pty ltd melbourne australia summary here is a faq contribution on gamma lines 184  in article 1t31meinnrc8gapcaltechedu madlerccocaltechedu mark adler writes    can someone who knows what theyre talking about add a faq entry  on gamma correction  thanks  i get regular questions about gamma correction since i go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli the image loader program i maintain  here is an explanation i often use to answer these questions  this might be suitable for inclusion in the faq  9graeme gill   a note on gamma correction and images  author graeme w gill         graemelabtamozau  date 93516   what is all this gamma stuff anyway    although it would be nice to think that an image is an image there are a lot of complications not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats gif jpeg tiff etc etc there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated gamma is one of those things if youve ever downloaded images from bbs or the net youve probably noticed with most image viewing programs that some images look ok some look too dark and some look too light why is this  you may ask this is gamma correction or the lack of it  why do we need gamma correction at all    gamma correction is needed because of the nature of crts cathode ray tubes  the monitors usually used for viewing images if you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene then you have created a linear or ungammacorrected image this is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light ie adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a crt you find that the crt doesnt give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage the amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this  lightout  voltage  crtgamma  so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a crt the image will look much too dark to fix this up you have to gamma correct the image first you need to do the opposite of what the crt will do to the image so that things cancel out and you get what you want so you have to do this to your image  gammacorrectedimage  image  1crtgamma  for most crts the crtgamma is somewhere between 10 and 30  if that is all it is why does it seem so complicated    the problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction also not all sources of images give you linear images video cameras or video signals in general because of this a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them and you are  rarely sure how much if you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light if you display one of those images with a program that doesnt do gamma correction then it will look vaguely right but not perfect because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular crt  whose fault is all this    it is really three things one is all those display programs out there that dont do gamma correction properly another is that most image formats dont specify a standard gamma or dont have some way or recording what their gamma correction is the third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about and create a lot of images with varying gammas  at least two file formats do the right thing the utah graphics toolkit rle format has a semistandard way of recording the gamma of an image the jfif file standard that uses jpeg compression specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 10 ie a linear image  but not everyone obeys the rules  some image loaders for instance xli  an x11 image utility allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view other image viewers eg xv another x11 image program and utilities eg the pbm toolkit provide ways of changing the gamma of an image but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has and then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt monitor   note that xv 221 doesnt provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image you need to adjust the r g and b curves to the appropriate gamma in the coledit controls altering the intensity in the hsv controls doesnt do the right thing as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on h and s this tends to give a tint to the image   how can i figure out what my viewer does or what gamma my screen has    the simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgammajpg provided with xli distribution which is a jfif jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps the ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye one using continuous tones and the other using dithering  if your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images then the two ramps should look symmetrical and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom to find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen and defocus your eyes a bit  if your viewer doesnt do gamma correction then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part and the point of equal brightness will be above the center  if your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma and decrease it if it is below the center the value will usually be around 22   with xli for instance you can adjust the display gamma with the dispgamma flag and once youve got it right you can set the displaygamma environment variable in your profile  how do i figure out what the gamma of an image is    this is the most tricky bit as a general rule it seems that a lot of true color ie 24 bit ppm jpg images have a gamma of 10 linear although there are many about that have some gamma correction it seems that the majority of pseudo color images ie 8 bit images with color maps  gif etc are gamma corrected to some degree or other  if your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good and gamma corrected images will look too light  if your viewer doesnt do gamma correction then linear images will look too dark and gamma corrected images will ok  why linear images are sometimes not such a good thing   one of the reason that many high quality formats such as video use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium this is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic this means images  could make better use of 8 bits per color for instance if they used gamma correction the implication though is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy since little popular software does this and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level  if some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing  i am told that

something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images  doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to 24bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations  think about what you are saying here the 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour  i suppose you dont know what about we have discussed we discussed about errors in xv 221 which shows images only as 8bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it  look be consistent first you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error  so i post and asy it is not a bug it is meant to be like that  so you post and say it is not a bug you never said it was i have misunderstood etc now you are saying  we discussed about errors in xv 221 which shows images only as 8bit  if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a lot easier    so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv  that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didnt tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place  eh sorry i dont understand what you are saying here i am aware that english is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning but this paragraph defeats me  gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as i presented theres no need make tricks from 8bitquantized image back to 24 bit image  yes as i originally said global changes are easily possible  but this statement contradicts what you said earlier   i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image    how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated  ok youre writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors  your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit  no i dont think so actually   you were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv by quantising manipulating the colours in the colour editor then somewhow applying these changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv xv lets you edit individual colours where is this sudden jumping off the topic  my solution doesnt work because theres no colormap withing real 24bit image   yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file   you see user see 24bit image going back to 8bit is silly  i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean  about changing individual colors in 8bitquantizedrasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized  small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image   what are you saying   xv allows this feature but i dont recommend to use it with the mentioned type images  ah now we see thew problem first you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images then i point out problems with this now you are saying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem   moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes   not sure what you are saying here certainly one can make local changes  in full 24bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have 8bit screen theres need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified because user dont see full 24bit image theres need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area  selecting individual color is possible from that  yes that is one possible approach i would find a program that took such an approach clumsy however  ok i dont have thought very much 24bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen  well here we agree  you have not thought it through very much you dont seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next ok we all have off days  perhaps you should step back and think this one through  yes again what is was wrong with xv  it saved 8bitquantizedrasterized images as 24bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that  as i said in the last post jpeg is a compression algorithm it is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression i fail to see what the problem is you have not proposed any workable alternatives  also human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image   speak for yourself you are the only person i have met or spoken to who having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 8 bit image palette  perhaps that is why you yused the singular  say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same   look next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel  it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit image xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit file you are the only person who claims this is confusing  so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work  design error  is a design error the same as a bug   read my lips xv is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images it lets you import other images it shows i would say a good deal of thought about the human interface and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for it makes no false claims  i have heard xv were designed first for 8bit imagesfiles but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design  if you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post them so  far you have not done so  so even all screen images are 8bit the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily instead of 8bit  argh after all this a comment like that very easily ok go ahead and code it if it is so easy  or alternatively look up the terms import and nonreversible transformation  before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals  however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesnt solve the problem americans the lift is just an example   i think this is a bit of an exageration  what you are actually saying is you got into a lift elevator if you are in the states   and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up everyone else had no problem now you are trying to sue the manufacturer  well my text may be a bit hard reading   you bet  hopefully you suggeeded to read it  mostly leaving aside the language issue however it betrays some very wooly thinking as you yourself

some more tests     first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic the movie i had been using only had 18 frames in it it was a    version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor    i decided something a little longer would give closer to realworld results    for better or for worse     i pulled out a copy of 2001 a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv    a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie theres a sequence where    the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized    a portion of about 30 seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space    station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only    5 frames per second to give a total of 171 frames     i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384288 pixels with the spigot    card in my centris 650 quartersize resolution from a pal source i then    imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor    keeping the 5 fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled    to 320240 resolution the other at 160120 resolution i used the default    200 quality setting in premiere 201 and specified a key frame every ten    frames     i then ran the 320240 movie through the same raw speed test program i used    for the results id been reporting earlier     result a playback rate of over 45 frames per second     thats right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie just for fun i copied the 320240 movie to my external hard    disk a quantum lp105s and ran it from there this time the playback rate    was only about 35 frames per second obviously the 230mb internal hard disk    also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback     i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors and tried playing back the 160120 movie scaled to 320240    size this time the playback speed was over 60 fps clearly the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 10 in    action not 15 id try my tests with quicktime 10 but i dont think its    entirely compatible with my centris and system 71     unscaled the playback rate for the 160120 movie was over 100 fps     the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 320240 movie with    preferred playback rates greater than 10 and seeing how well they played    from within movieplayer ie with quicktimes normal synchronized playback    a preferred rate of 90  45 fps didnt work too well the playback was    very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved 45 fps with    ease i cant believe that quicktimes synchronization code would add this    much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac systems task    switching     a preferred rate of 70  35 fps seemed to work fine i couldnt see    any evidence of stutter at 80  40 fps i think i could see slight    stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell     i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also    improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance    even more

zealand    37 47 26 s 175 19 7 e gmt1200   im afraid i missed the start of this thread but there are three factors that can significantly affect quicktimes playback speed that you may want to take into account  1 playback bit depth things are fastest when you play a movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for this is usually 8 or 16 bit but other depths are of course possible  2 type of scaling qt is optimized for double size scaling other scaling factors hit peformance much harder  3 playback window position movieplayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default im not sure about premiere  any combination of those can radically alter playback performance  image size is of course another biggie  giving the movie player lots of ram can also make a real difference  forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread  peter lee      peter e lee software conductor                         specular international inc

bighearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm  lets  suppose that this is a true dichotomy so papb1 trouble is alterius   is in a different universe so that no observations of alterius are possible  except for the banks  you couldnt possibly afford it     now lets examine the case for a  there is no evidence whatsoever that  there is any such thing as a bighearted alterian benefactor however  pexistsbh a b  pnotexistsbh a b  1 on the grounds that   lackofevidencefor is evidenceagainst when we have a partition like  that we dismiss hypothesis a   turning therefore to b we also find no evidence to support that  hypothesis  on the same grounds as before we dismiss hypothesis b   the problem with this is that we have dismissed all of the possible  hypotheses and even though we know by construction that the money   arrives every month we have proven that it cant because we  have dismissed all of its potential causes   thats an extremely poor argument and heres why   premise 1 this money is being paid to you by either a your big              hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm    thus each monthly appearance of the bucks should it happen is an  observation on alterius and by construction is evidence for the  existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the atm    premise 2 no observations on alterius are possible        except for the banks  you couldnt possibly afford it    you forgot to include this  my premise is actually   premise 2  the cardinality of the set of possible observations on alterius              is one   this is clearly contradictory to the first   not if you state it properly   trouble is on the basis of premise 2 you say that there can be no evidence  of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premise leads to the  conclusion that the appearance of the bucks should it happen is evidence  for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug    voila a screaming contradiction  with my highlights  sc  but in a strawman argument there is only evidence for oneofbenefactorbug  no observation to distinguish benefactor from bug is possible that is    not evidence for bug and neither is it evidence for benefactor nor    is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as  if there were no benefactorbug two statements both would be false  this is still contradictory it reduces to    1 alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug    2 this is not evidence for benefactor neither is it evidence for        bug meaning that it doesnt lend more weight to one than to the        other    3 therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence        can exist for bug  but 3 relies on a shift in meaning from 2 when you say paraphrased in 2 that this is not evidence for benefactor for example what you mean is that its no more evidence for benefactor than it is for bug  yes thats what i mean  in 3 however youve shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor so that it now means absolute evidence for benefactor rather than relative evidence for benefactor wrt bug  not really i meant evidence that would tend to one over the other  i think this is just a communications problem   what i am trying to say in my clumsy way is that while i buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions prayer your rapture example i dont buy your use of occams razor in all cases where a0  in my example one couldnt dismiss benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity  one of these is necessary to explain the dosh  i brought up the onebyone dismissal process to show that it would be wrong to do so  from what youre saying in this post it seems you agree and were talking at crosspurposes  3 is still in contradiction to 1  some sums may help with b  benefactor b  bug d  dosh arrives in account    1 implies  pbb  d  1  assuming that pbb  d  0 so its either the benefactor or a bug which is responsible if the bucks arrive but not both then     pbb  d      pb  d  pb  d  so     pb  d  pb  d    1  but 3 implies that     pb  d    0  and  pb  d    0  no this isnt what i meant  pb  d  05 and pb  d  05 with necessarily no new observation weve already seen the dosh to change those estimates  i was trying to say again in my clumsy way that it would be wrong to assign 0 probability to either of these  and thats precisely what use of the razor does in the case of gods  gods are one class of hypothesis there are many others belonging to a set of hypotheses oneofwhich is necessary to explain something which otherwise  would not be satisfactorily explained  it can be thrown out or retained on grounds of nonrational preference not of science or statistics    alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the grounds that the answer cant be known or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless being equal agnosticismweak atheism   as they do when the set m is filled by the universe is caused by x  where x is gods pink unicorns nothing etc   and no observation  tends to one conclusion over the other  exactly the point i was making i think so we dont throw out any of these contrary to your assertion above that we do  some people do simon and they think they are doing excellent science my sole point was that they arent   only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis hi ie x  where px  hi  0 can cause phi to go to zero after a finite  number of observations only in this case do we get to throw any of the  hypotheses out   exactly my point though i may have been unclear  you said the diametric opposite which i guess is the source of my confusion  i was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so   what im trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of  evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this does not hold true for  all or perhaps any versions of theism  and it isnt true that those for  which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor  on the contrary those for which it does not hold are exactly those which can be discarded using the razor see my post on the other branch of this thread  then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of  if the razor holds for gods then it holds for all like hypotheses  which means that youre assigning px  hi 0 for all i though weve already established that its not correct to do so when sumpxhi1 over all i   simply put anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or  nonexistence of gods whether inductive or no is at best mistaken and  at worst barking mad  luckily i make no such claim and have specifically said as much on numerous occasions you wouldnt be constructing a strawman here would you frank although that doesnt of course rule out my being barking mad in any case i could be barking mad in my spare time with apologies to cleese et al  but i think you miss the point once again when i say that something is evidence against an hypothesis that doesnt imply that observation of the said something necessarily falsifies the hypothesis reducing the estimate of ph  data to zero if it reduces this quantity its still evidence against h  no i got that  im talking about the case when a0  youre clearly correct when a0   and im not constructing a strawman though its certainly possible that ive misunderstood what youre saying  however by any standards a system that says when a0 gods are highly unlikely and when a0 gods can be dismissed using the razor is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either dont exist or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena  in my experience systems such as this including those which purport to prove that gods exist always contain a fallacy upon close examination  if thats not what youre saying then please put me straight   frank odwyer                                  im not hatching that odwyersseie                                  from

unorganized usenet postings uninc xnewsreader vms news 124 lines 151  in 1r34n3hfjhorusapmchpsnide frankd012s658uucp writes   deletia in case anybody hadnt noticed frank and i are debating   objective morality and seemingly hitting semantics    secondly  how can i refute your definition  i can only point up its  logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage  of the word objective in other areas  indeed by your definition an  objective x is an oxymoron for all x  i have no quibble with that  belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly  good word        it may be that being a nonnative englishspeaker ive misunderstood your usage of objective and tried to debate something you dont assert my apologies im at a loss to imagine what you really do mean though        how many ages can the universe have and still be internally self consistent id be amazed if it was more than one how many different moral systems can different members of society have  indeed single individuals in some cases  and humanity still stick together    begging the question  people can have many opinions about the age  of the universe and humanity can still stick together   you are  saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about  it  why        wrong point the age of the universe has no direct effect on humanitys sticking power in the way the moral system of a society can have        im saying the universe has a real age because i see evidence for it cosmology astronomy and so on i say this age is independent of peoples opinions of it because i know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results        the age of the universe like most scientific facts can be emirically verified through means thatll give the same result no matter who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the largish side     this assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality  which doesnt depend on what we think        i cant see how it does that put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations see to it she makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating and the result of the test will be the same   why should an extreme biblical  creationist give a rats ass about the means of which you speak        because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion if those tests were just my opinion then their own tests which would then be their opinion would contradict mine even if we conducted said tests in identical manner no they dont which i take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them  ive heard of no way to verify morality in a consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to enlighten me    the same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted  to work with some accuracy better than a random guess        map the activity of nerves and neural activity if you mean physical pain you have a sharp point ill give you that but you still havent given me a way to quantify morality   i wrote  elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value        we agree hypotheses however can change i hold that there is no ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could gravitate but that they could be changed in any way imaginable producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes   if a moral system makes a prediction it will be better if  that can be tested        better and worse are almost always defined in the context of a moral system your prediction will always be correct within that moral system what you need now is an objective definition of good and bad i wish you luck        peoples ideas about the age of object x are not objective you can have any idea you like and i cant stop you universae and their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you dislike some detail of them thats a problem with your opinion of them     sure  assume an objective reality and you get statements like this        isnt that what youre doing when assuming an objectively real morality besides what exactly is provably wrong with my statement  i claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such subjective and individual if im wrong then some moreorless objectively real thing exists which you label objective morality can you back up this positive claim of existence    can you back up your positive claim above  no  thats because its an  assumption  i make the same assumption about values on the basis  that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical  basis of the two is precisely the same        claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim besides i think i can lend some credence to my claim ponder different individuals both fully functional as human beings and members of society but yet with wildly different moral codes if morality was objective at least one should be way off base but yet hir incorrect morality seems to function fine how come        as for producing these individuals it might be easiest to pick them from different societies say an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system for example if such still exist   deletia  testing for footballs on desks         now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform me which way to look and why to look that particular way as opposed to some other get my drift    no just look  are you claiming never to know what good means        one thing is good under some circumstances because we wish to achieve some goal for some reason other times we wish to do something else and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all        some things are hard to make good because wed seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into still the aztecs were doing fine until the spaniards wiped them out        i almost always know what good means sometimes i even know why i never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone immutable         thats a simple matter of proving the track record of the scientific method    i think its great and should be applied to values  i may be completely  wrong but thats what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of  thought        yes me too and ive tried a thing or two down that line it doesnt look good for objective values to me at all      disclaimer   its great to be young and insane ,0

correct email address to reply to      1  what is jpeg  jpeg pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 1bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   2  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 24bitperpixel color data instead of 8bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 2 mbyte fullcolor file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 24 bitspixel 16 million colors instead of 8 or less 256 or fewer colors  if you have only 8bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 8bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 7 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   3  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 24bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 7 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 256 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 14 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   4  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 727x525 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 6b  file9   size in bytes99comments  shipppm91145040  original file in ppm format no compression 24 bits 999 or 3 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead shipppmz9 963829  ppm file passed through unix compress 999 compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note 999 other textoriented compressors give similar results shipgif9 240438  converted to gif with ppmquant fs 256  ppmtogif 999 most of the savings is the result of losing color 999 info gif saves 8 bitspixel not 24  see sec 7  shipjpg959 155622  cjpeg q 95    highest useful quality setting 999 this is indistinguishable from the 24bit original 999 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs shipjpg759  58009  cjpeg q 75    default setting 999 you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 999 from the original even with both onscreen at once shipjpg509  38406  cjpeg q 50 999 this has slight defects if you know what to look 999 for you could tell its been jpeged without seeing 999 the original  still as good image quality as many 999 recent postings in usenet pictures groups shipjpg259  25192  cjpeg q 25 999 jpegs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent 999 at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some 999 still ive seen plenty of usenet postings that were 999 of poorer image quality than this shipjpg5o9   6587  cjpeg q 5 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead 999 blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 999 indexing purposes  note that this file is tiny 999 the compression ratio from the original is 1731   in this case jpeg can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 75 file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   5  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 95 does not mean keep 95 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 75 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 75 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 95 saying q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 95 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 50 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 75 is about right for compressing 24bit images but q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting gifs see section 14 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right  q 2 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   6  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   6a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  xv shareware 25 is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats  it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu 1824012 file contribxv300tarz  version 300 is a major upgrade with support for 24bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking  if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 221 also available from export  note that version 221 is not a good choice if you have a 24bit display youll get only 8bit color nor for converting 24bit images to jpeg  but 221 works fine for converting gif and other 8bit images to jpeg  caution there is a glitch in version 221 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 24bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 303  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage303tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 303 is using a hackedover v1  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli114tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 24bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os2 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 25 is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 129975050 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg25zip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386486 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 12 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv12zip  hiview requires a 386 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm386 and 386max work windows and os2 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 30  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 21 available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview21zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv2zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 860a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 25  available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw860azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic50 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg4zip or jpeg4386zip if you have a 386 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 6b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif2jpgjpg2gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 24bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 20 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif2jpg2zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image

simtel20 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel20 that really means pd1msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel20 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 14121010117 which keeps simtel20 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel20 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 10 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 31 and 256ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version 09 is available from ftpcicaindianaedu 129792084 file pubpcwin3desktopjview090zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchivewustledu  winjpeg shareware 20 displays jpeggiftargatiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and slideshow  the current version is 21 available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows3winjp210zip  this is a slow 286compatible version if you register youll get the 386only version which is roughly 25 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 30  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 097 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin3desktopcview097zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors

quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running system 607 or later  if youre running system 6 you must also install the 32bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 7  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 1192 this file contains quicktime 15 which is better than qt 10 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 15  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 10 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 20 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 364406 file infomacappjpegview20hqx  requires system 7 and quicktime  on 8bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 40 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 232  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter232hqx  requires system 605 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert10hqx this will run on any

version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt10stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 7 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 32bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress201hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 32bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 201 or later can read and write

bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 8bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 256orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 256 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 256color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 256 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 256color gif on a 16color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan8bit display hardware already 15bit hicolor pc displays true 24bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   8  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart13  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   9  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 100 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v4 free jpeg code you can also say sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 6 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   10  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 60 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 60 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 6a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 11 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif2jpgjpg2gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   11  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  1  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d8 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 10 followed by jfif  2  if you see ff d8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  3  hsi files start with hsi1  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  4  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it  5  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d8     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  9begin line 9mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  9begin line 9mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   12  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   13  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    14  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 3 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 12 or 13rd the size of the gif file not 14th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 75 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v4 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 10 or so when converting gifs values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 85 smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg group at jpeginfouunetuunet    999tom lane 999organizer

been posted already but there are a number of items not seen here yet  redesign activities update  following is the weekly status on redesign based on information provided by nasa headquarters  the station redesign team srt provided a detailed status report to the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april 22  the daylong meeting was held in anser facilities in crystal city va topics covered by the srt included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station science technology and engineering research the assessment process and the design approach discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held  the design teams then presented the three options under study  ¥ option a  modular buildup  pete priest presented the a option priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution  power station human tended and permanent presence the team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels the a option uses current or simplified freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the socalled bus1 spacecraft the orbiter and spacelab  the power station capability could be achieved in 3 flights with freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kw of power 30day shuttlespacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase  human tended capability would be provided by the addition of the us common module module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for esa and japanese laboratories 60day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase different operationutilization modes are being studied for this phase  ¥ option b  freedom derived  mike griffin presented the status of option b activities griffin detailed the evolution of the freedomderived option from initial research capability to humantended capability to permanent human presence capability to two fault tolerance and finally permanent human capability griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program with minor changes to the communications and tracking system crew health care system and eclss and a major change to the data management system  initial research capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 285 degree inclination 3 flights to 516 degrees and consist of an extended duration orbiterspacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 1875 kw of power  humantended capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the us lab  permanent human presence capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return  two fault tolerance achieved in 11 flights would build out the other section of truss with another set of pv modules thermal control and propulsion systems  the freedom derived configuration could achieve an international complete state with 16 flights  three more flights to bring up the habitat module a third pv array and two assured crew return vehicles acrv would complete the permanent human capability with international stage  griffin told the redesign advisory committee that eliminating hardware would not by itself meet budget guidelines for the freedom derived option  major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management contractor nonhardware early utilization and operations costs he said  ¥ option c  singe launch core station  chet vaughn presented option c the single launch core station concept  a shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit  shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after et separation  the module 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long would provide 26000 cubic feet of pressured volume separated into 7 decks connected by a centralized passageway  seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules and other elements  this can would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kw of power flying in a solar interial attitude  in his closing comments to the redesign advisory committee bryan oconnor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on april 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin  the next meeting with the redesign advisory committee will be may 3  russian consultants arrive in us  a delegation of 16 russian space experts arrived in the us on april 21 and briefings to the srt by members of the russian team began on the 22nd  the group includes russian space agency general director y m koptev and v a yatsenko also of the rsa  others on the team include representatives from the ministry of defense the design bureau salyut the institute of biomedical problems the ministry of foreign affairs npo energia and tsnijmash  the russian team briefed the srt on environmental control and life support system docking systems the proton launch vehicle mir operations and utilization and the soyuz tm spacecraft  the russian consultants are available to the srt to assess the capabilities of the mir space station and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign  they will be available to the srt through may 5  management and operations review continues   work continued in the srt subgroups  the management group under dr walt brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations  various management options have been developed including  ¥ lead center with the center director in the programmatic chain of command  ¥ host center with the program manager reporting directly to an associate administrator  ¥ skunk worksdedicated program office with a small dedicated colocated handpicked program office  ¥ combine space station with shuttle with the space station becoming an element of the current program  ¥ major tune up to current organization with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined  the operations group under dr john cox is building on the work of the operations phase assessment team lead by gene kranz of nasajsc which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible  as part of its work  the operations group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations utilization maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations  whats in the week ahead  the design support teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the station redesign team on monday and tuesday at which point the design will be frozen to begin the detailed cost assessment   also this week the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign advisory committee to be held may 3  dr shea steps down   dr joe shea stepped down as director of the station redesign team on april 22 and bryan oconnor will take over the activities of the team  dr shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis but will continue to serve as a special advisory to nasa administrator goldin and be available to consult with the srt mr goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from dr shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated  key milestones  the key dates for the srt as they are currently being carried on the schedule are  april 26 design freeze on options for costing  april 27 design support team present

aside the theologizing jargon such as slaves of christ  the point is that adherents of a religion will read the texts whether classified as inspired or not that are held up as models in an effort to find application to their own situations  this practice ranges from devotional reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon ical scripture as the word of god  and at the highest pitch this leads to a question of whether we can find in inspired scripture something that can act as absolute guidance for our actions  the problem is in finding out just what it is our lord commands  i am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which christians have looked for these commands namely christian tradition  that is not because i reject tradition but because my primary audience in this essay is protestants who deny tradition a determinative value in favor of the witness of scripture  the question i want to deal with is what commandments can we find from our lord in scripture  and that turns out to be a hard question   if any of my protestant inquisitors would like to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition i can accomodate them  unlike most protestants episcopalians admit claims from a scripture b reason and c tradition on roughly equal standing   earlier in john than my quote above we read john 1334 i give you a new  commandment love one another  this is the only place in the nt where christians are given an explicit commandment with the context commenting on its imperative mode pronouncement by jesus  at the same meal so we readers infer since it is not in john but in the synoptics jesus says take this bread this is my body  mark 1422 cf matthew 2626 luke 2219 1 corinthians 1124  the mode is imperative greek labete and hence this too is a commandment  in both cases we have to infer that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples  because we judge the evangelists point in mentioning it with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead is that we are expected to follow this as a commandment from our lord  in the case of communion pauls mention at least this is probably true of the evangelists also implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to bind christians to the original command to his disciples as a continuing commandment to the christian community  i am entirely comfortable with this inference but i must point out that it is there between us and the occasion on which jesus spoke the command i take it as a clear inference at the very least the evangelists notion that all christians are called to love one another in jesus command directed at the disciples  but i have to call attention to the inference the command cannot apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a disciple of christ  all reading of scripture has to make such inferences to get any sense out of the text whatsoever  this is a general problem in reading these texts  we cannot read them at all without our own understanding of our native languages in which we normally read the translated texts and without some appreciation of the original context and at points the original languages when english misleads us i am going to presume in what follows that we have the general problem of how to read scripture under control  i dont really think this is true but it will suffice for my current purposes   i will address only the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in  questions at that level only introduce more reser vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done  among the reasons we have for seeing johns agapate allelou as a general commandment not merely an instruction by jesus to this disciples on that one occasion and one linking it to the synoptic great commandment is that we have criticism from jesus about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with  in matthew 543ff we read you have learnt how it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy  but i say to you love your enemies  in fact the leviticus context quoted does not say hate your enemy  it is merely the common human presumption and leviticus is at pains to say that the love should extend to strangers amongst the people of israel  luke in expanding on this same q context goes on to have jesus say even sinners love those who love them 627 all of this suggests quite strongly id say  that limiting the scope of the new commandment is not quite what jesus has in mind  in short inference leads me to generalizing the actual text to a command that is in force on christians and with objects not limited to other christians  trickier than the agapate allelou or institution of communion there is the case of the great commission where matthew 10 mark 6 the twelve are sent out to evangelize proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand  the verb is imperative kerussete but the context is rather specific to the twelve and there are further specifiers as in do not turn your steps to pagan territory and do not enter any samaritan town  the lukan parallels are even more specific to jesus final journey to jerusalem which make it harder to see this generalizing to all christians than the previous examples  that hasnt prevented christians from making such an inference what i have to call attention to is that such inference is not justified in the text nor unlike the first two cases i cite by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader  still paul seems to have felt obliged to proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand even contrary to jesus instructions to the 12  to the gentiles to the ends of the earth  so christians after him have also taken this as a commandment in the sense of john 1415  do i accept this  i dont know  it is surely rather speculative  but you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext  christians may infer a general commandment applicable to all from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion  i do not necessarily object to this kind of generalization  but i insist that people who make it must have an understanding that they are reasoning at some considerable length from what we actually have in scripture  there are assumptions involved in this reasoning and these are not themselves scriptural though people will do their best to justify their assumptions by other references to scripture  which simply adds more inference into the mix  lets move on to the great commandment  that we should love god with our whole hearts and minds and souls  this is perhaps the synoptic equivalent of johns agapate allelou  and yet  it is not presented as a commandment in our texts  rather the context is controversy with the pharisees  to cite matthew 2234ff  9but when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees 9they got together and to disconcert him one of them put a question 9master which is the greatest commandment of the law  it is by no means obvious here though i accept it as such that jesus answer is meant to be a commandment to christians  he is answering a polemic from his enemies   marks account in  122834 casts the answer in a far more positive light as so the scribe in this version says far more important than any holocaust i need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice forget the nazis for this or sacrifice  luke is intermediate  he has a lawyer posing the question to disconcert jesus and gets the good samarian parable for his pains  luke 102537   the contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing no inferences   in no account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on christians  though i think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that jesus thinks it to be so  the point is that our mental gears have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what we are commanded to do by jesus  and all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of jesus use of the torah in the all quite different gospel accounts and the application of such a context to us  the different contexts among the synoptics are curious  it should be noted that only in luke do we get the fixing of this command by the parable of the good samaritan  we may look for an analogous intent in matthew where 712 gives the golden rule as the meaning of the law and the prophets and where we may also hear an echo of hillel saying the same a generation before jesus  if we make these associations which i think are entirely reasonable we are  again  indulging in inference  the texts do not explicitly support us rather we read the texts as having this kind of interrelationship  current literary theory calls this intertextuality  my discussion of why the agapate allelou has to apply beyond the  community of the disciples and beyound the circle of christian believers applies again here to buttress a conclusion that this is despite the presentation not saying so explicitly a commandment to christians few christians would disagree with my conclusions  but i must point out that they are conclusions they depend on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply not present in the texts themselves  the contextual problem keeps coming up more and more severely as we look at those sayings of jesus that are not so universally taken by christians as  commandments  and we get some really hard cases  take divorce  mark is  pretty clear the man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her   1011 cf luke 1618   except that matthew has an escape clause  except in the case of fornication 531  this seems to be a rather clear commandment whether or not we take matthews reservation and some christians to this day take it so  but some dont at least in practice  this is rather peculiar it is not as if jesus were not explicit about this whereas he says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over  how is it possible if the commands of christ are clear that matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition  im going to continue this examination into evermurkier waters but this is enough to start with  the theme is finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference our inferences are informed by our assumptions that is our own cultural biases  i have so far identified a very few commandments that are generally accepted by all christians  and yet in these already some of the difficulties start to surface  it is these difficulties i want to discuss in my next essay on this topic  the divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties i see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn me with spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soccouples or misclegal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce or demanding that us law refuse to allow it or refuse unrepentant divorcees places in their churches   that is not to say that divorce doesnt enter into  consideration in general  it is most definitely a matter of concern in even the most liberal church circles  for example a wildly liberal episcopalian priest of my aqauintence in a wildly liberal diocese has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a private secular ceremony before a judge so that the public ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing examination by officials who would just as soon not take on this role of interpreting the commands we are faced with as christians  this in a church that was effectively created by a famous divorce    michael l siemon99i say you are gods sons of the mlspanixcom999most high all of you nevertheless      or 999you shall die like men and fall

the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to bw conversion   6 rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle  the obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination this is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination  instead loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the reverse transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the source this method is quite general and can be used for any onetoone 2d mapping not just rotation  you can add antialiasing by doing subpixel sampling  however there is a much faster method with antialising included which involves doing three shear operations  the method was originally created for the im raster toolkit see below an

of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message  see item 13 below for details on some  also the newsgroup altgraphicspixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this  you may find useful information there   8 format documents for tiff iff biff nff off fits etc  you almost certainly dont need these  read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software  get one or more of these packages and look through them  chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there  but if you still want one of the format documents many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhofcsriceedu in directory pubgraphicsformats  these files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct this archive includes pixel formats and two and threedimensional object formats  the future of this archive is uncertain at the moment as mark hall foocsriceedu will apparently no longer be maintaining it  a second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by quincey koziol koziolncsauiucedu  the latest version exists at ftpncsauiucedu in miscfileformatsgraphicsformats  apparently neither of these is complete you might want to check both  fits stands for flexible image transport system its a file format most often used in astronomy  despite the name it can contain not only images but other things as well  there is a regular monthly fits basics and information posting on sciastrofits  read it if you want to know more    9 converting between vector formats  a lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript or macdraw to cgm or whatever  it is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7  converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel  the basic objects are the same for all image formats  this is not so for vector formats the basic objects  circles ellipses dropshadowed patternfilled roundcornered rectangles etc  vary from one format to another except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a onetoone conversion between vector formats  there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftppscedu  the contributor states that it runs on unix mswindows and possibly the mac a better more specific blurb would be most welcome  on the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another as far as i know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been posted to compsourcesmisc  check the index on your nearest archive site  a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image  from postscript to sun raster format or hpgl to x11 bitmap  for example some of the commercial postscript clones for pcs allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer  also the postscript interpreters in the next box and in suns x11news can be used to render to a file if youre clever  but in general the answer is no  however if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial  gnu ghostscript from the fsf  current version 252 includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a postscript to ppm  or a postscript to gif filter  it implements essentially all of postscript level 1 and alot of display postscript and level 2   10 how to get pixar films  the various john lasseter  pixar computer animated shorts are available on video tape  you can order them from direct cinema limited

acceptable but it is sensitive to scale  magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies  deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large  if you want to do the job right consult the article    a menagerie of rational bspline circles   by leslie piegl and wayne tiller   in ieee computer graphics and applications volume 9 number 9

how to ftp by email  there are a number of sites that archive the usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system  you send a message to an automated server saying something like send compsourcesunixfbm and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail  in addition there is at least one ftpbymail server  send mail to ftpmaildecwrldeccom saying help and it will tell you how to use it  note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse   14 how to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon  consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity  if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the polygon  if the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges  this idea is known in the trade as the jordan curve theorem see eric haines article in glassners ray tracing book above for more information including treatment of special cases  another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon  if the sum is 2 pi the point is inside if the sum is 0 the point is outside  however this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly  code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in the ray tracing news vol 5 no 3 available from princetonedu pubgraphicsrtnewsrtnv5n3z   15 how to tessellate a sphere  one simple way is to do

wrote    in article 1993apr2200440528052bnrca rashid writes  stuff deleted  the point of my post was that rushdie was not being condemned solely  for the words in his book although this was certainly a contributing  factor it was the whole series of actions of rushdie and his  publishers following the publication of the book and the initial media  spotlight placed on the book that in large part led to the fatwa the  kind of fatwa levelled against rushdie is not lightly placed and there  are any number of antiislamic writers both within and outside the  islamic world who have not had fatwas made against them here someone  who adds fuel to an explosive situation might be charged with incitement  to riot  if people die in the rioting the charges against him might  become even more serious    how can rushdie be blamed for the deaths of people who are demonstrating  against him  the deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with  the demonstrations or on the demonstrators themselves if they were  violent  to what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour  against rushdie  once the rushdie situation exploded into the media the muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of muslim demonstrations for every twenty or so newspaper magazine articles interviews etc supporting rushdie there would appear one muslim voice this person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was not on his knowledge of islam or the situation at the time this approx twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis with rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment the valiant defender of everymans right to free speech decoupled from responsibility as an aside its interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up some books defaming certain ethnic and religious groups continued to be banned here it was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these  groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of  hate towards these groups for muslims this kind of double standard  was annoying  rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at organized islam and he did so with admirable verbal skill the only kind of islam which rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a secular islam  an islam separated from its quran its prophet god its legislation and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena fine  rushdie made his views known  the muslims made their anger at his book known the scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions  it was by this time already a political situation  affecting governments as well as individuals the situation was a serious one with farreaching political implications at the centre of this turmoil was rushdie throwing fuel on the fire  engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution  now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as  this has no responsibility has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down perhaps you even feel that he is justified in boldly defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work no matter what insult they find within it perhaps you see him as a kind of secular heroic knightmounted on the his media steed  doing battle with the dragon of islamic fundamentalism  well khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who  grew up in a muslim atmosphere knew well what muslims hold dear  who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander insult and attack islam and its most notable personalities  who when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media  who even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation continued his mischief instead of having the good sense to desist khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged the deaths of muslims around the world and rushdies continued media mischief even after this was the triggering factor that seemed to decide khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief the person at the centre of all these events was rushdie  he was the source of the continuing mischief  all media support government support was just that  support the source was rushdie and his publishers who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see rushdie constantly in the media the islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grandscale mischief making was applied to rushdie  youre attempts at justification are not doing the  image of islam any good  i have made no attempts at justification only at explanation image is the chief concern of muslim apologists for islam and for rushdie if muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a subculture within a larger secular culture such that the secular principles and laws had precedence over the laws of islam  then i have no doubt that islam would then be thought to have a good image principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image a good image usually means  be more like me  your attempts at totally exonerating rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis    in iran the situation was monitored for many  months  when rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free  worldwide voice that the media gave him the situation was monitored  more seriously when even after many deaths occured worldwide rushdie  still did not desist  the fatwa was pronounced when behaving like  a total jerk endangers lives and the jerk sees this and still insists  on his right to behave like a total jerk  he has the rug jerked out  from under him    if the muslims didnt make such a big fuss over the book like issuing  death threats and killing publishers no one would have heard of it  the fatwa came later  much later if rushdie didnt mouth off so much in the media the fuss would have died down  no one would have been killed no fatwa would have been passed  the whole episode would have fizzled away ,0

writes        ah that old chestnut your claim that moral objectivism  scientific objectivism i dont agree with it now try proving through some objective moral test that my disagreeing is incorrect     your claim which you have deleted now was not universal  not objective        ive deleted it now in the interest of brevity go back a step and youll see it was still in your post yes that was my claim if you can refute it then please do so  firstly an apology  you hadnt deleted your claim and i was mistaken in saying you had sorry for any offence caused  secondly  how can i refute your definition  i can only point up its logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage of the word objective in other areas  indeed by your definition an objective x is an oxymoron for all x  i have no quibble with that belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly good word   so what is objective  not the age of the universe anyway as i show  above        how many ages can the universe have and still be internally self consistent id be amazed if it was more than one how many different moral systems can different members of society have  indeed single individuals in some cases  and humanity still stick together  begging the question  people can have many opinions about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together   you are saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about it  why        the age of the universe like most scientific facts can be emirically verified through means thatll give the same result no matter who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the largish side   this assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality which doesnt depend on what we think   why should an extreme biblical creationist give a rats ass about the means of which you speak  ive heard of no way to verify morality in a consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to enlighten me  the same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted to work with some accuracy better than a random guess  i wrote elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value if a moral system makes a prediction it will be better if that can be tested and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction this drug will relieve pain        peoples ideas about the age of object x are not objective you can have any idea you like and i cant stop you universae and their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you dislike some detail of them thats a problem with your opinion of them   sure  assume an objective reality and you get statements like this  i claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such subjective and individual if im wrong then some moreorless objectively real thing exists which you label objective morality can you back up this positive claim of existence  can you back up your positive claim above  no  thats because its an assumption  i make the same assumption about values on the basis that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical basis of the two is precisely the same        point morals are in essence personal opinions usually ideally wellfounded motivated such but nonetheless personal the fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question sometimes even for the same reason does not make morals objective it makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question which can be good for the evolution of a social species    and if a real large lot nice phrase of people agree that there is a   football on a desk im supposed to see a logical difference between the two    perhaps you can explain the difference to me since you seem to see it  so clearly        take a look on the desk  ie perform a test iffootball then accept theory else do tell people theyre hallucinating        now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform me which way to look and why to look that particular way as opposed to some other get my drift  no just look  are you claiming never to know what good means        science is a whole other matter altogether    says you  prove that those who disagree are wrong        thats a simple matter of proving the track record of the scientific method  i think its great and should be applied to values  i may be completely wrong but thats what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought    frank odwyer                                  im not hatching that odwyersseie

 zoroaster is far older than daniel if anything one could claim that in a sense daniel is a descendant of zoroaster as daniel though being hebrew has assimilated into zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the tanakh of judaism however the majority  of the book is in hellenistic aramaic not babylonian aramaic and only has kethuvim or writing status  ref encyclopedia of religion mircea eliade  daniel or in hebrew daniyyel hero of the biblical book that bears his name daniel is presented as a jew in the babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lions pit he also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of israels restoration to nationalreligious autonomy as a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court described in daniel 16 written in the third person daniel per forms his interpretations alone while as a visionaryapocalyptist in daniel 712 written in the first person he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future it is likely that the name daniel is pseudonymous a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition ez 144283   the authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language daniel 1124a and 812 are written in hebrew whereas daniel 24b728 is in aramaic the language division parallels the subject division daniel 16 concerns legends and dream interpretations 712 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies the overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances daniel 27 is chiliastically related suggest an attempt at redactional unity after the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion a chronological ordering is discernable a sequence from king nebuchadrezzar to darius is reported dn 712 much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic for example daniel 4 speaks of nebuchadrezzars transformation into a beast a story that is reported in the qumran scrolls of nabonidus belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of babylon although he was never king and darius is called a mede who conquered babylon and is placed before cyrus ii of persia although no such darius is known the medes followed the persians and darius is the name of several persian kings presumably the episodes of daniel 26 depicting a series of monarchical reversals episodes of ritual observances and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the seleucid period late fourth to midsecond century bce in order to reinvigorate waning jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith   the visions of daniel 712 reporting events from the reign of belshazzar to that of cyrus ii but actually predicting the overthrow of seleucid rule in palestine were collected and published during the reign of antiochus iv prior to the maccabean revolt for it was then beginning in 168 bce that the jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to judaism and their ancestral traditions and many refused to desecrate the statues of moses and endured a martyrs death for their resolute trust in divine dominion all of the visions of daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways for example via images of the enthronement of a god of judgment with a son of man invested with rule this figure was interpreted by jews as michael the archangel and by christians as christ in chapter 7 via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations as in chapter 8 or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies especially those of jeremiah 25911 as found in daniel 912   the imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter 2 representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin is one of the enduring images of the book it sur vived as a prototype of jewish and christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the middle ages the role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete isaac abravanel the scientist isaac newton and the philosopher jean bodin and among the fifth monarchy men of seventeenth century england for example is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups the schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent   the encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in daniel 1112 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of isaiah 52135312 regarding the suffering servant of god not as all israel but as the select faithful neither the opening stories about daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt they rather advocate a stance of piety civil disobedience and trustful resignation victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel michael and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the maccabean fighters and may reflect some protopharisaic group of hasidim or pietists the themes of resistance to oppression freedom of worship preservation of monotheistic integrity the overthrow of historical dominions and the acknowledgement of the god of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour  zarathushtra founder of the religion know as zoroastrianism or mazdaism from mazda or ahura mazda the name of the god prophesied by zarathushtra the etymology and history of zarathushtra the avestan and oldest form of the name as uncertain both in various iranian languages and in related forms else where there may have been an old persian form zaraushtra from which the greek form zoroastres may be derived and there may have existed an old iranian form zaratushtra to which may be linked the middle iranian zrdrwsht several middle persian forms such as zrtwsht and the new persian zardusht we can state with certainty only that the second half of the name ushtra means camel the form zoroaster derived from the greek zoroastres was used traditionally in european culture until the eighteenth century when zarathustra closer to the original and as found in nietzsche came into common use after the rediscovery of the avesta the collection of sacred books of zoroastrianism and the resulting studies in iranian philology see avesta   notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of zarathushtra even in western culture the sources available to us are few extremely fragmented and heterogeneous our principle sources are the five gathas songs attributed to zarathushtra himself and included in the yasna section of the avesta gatha ahunavaiti yasna 2834 gatha ushtavaiti yasna 4346 gatha spentamainyu yasna 4750 gatha vokukhshathra yasna 51 and gatha vashishtoishti yasna 53 the last of which was probably written after the prophets death   other sources of considerable albeit varying importance are the younger avesta and the remaining zoroastrian religious literature in particular the pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures ce although the achaemenid inscriptions sixth to fourth centures bce never mention zarathushtra he is mentioned by some greek sources of the time not however by herodotus who seems unaware of him   the avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of zarathushtra but the text is useful in an indirect way as it clearly implies that the environment in which zoroastrianism arose was not that of iran under the medes or the persians the greek sources on the other hand do provide some information concerning the time of zarathushtra although from a historical point of view they are unreliable some place him six thousand years before the trojan war xanthus of lydia eudoxus of cnidus hermippus hermodorus aristotle plutarch diogenes laertius and pliny the account by xanthus of lydia however has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred rather than six thousand years before the expedition of xerxes against greece this interpretation is favored by diogenes laertius who makes reference to xanthus but although a few scholars a s shabazi helmut humbach have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts it is generally rejected   although the historical value of the greek sources is negligible they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in iran by the achaemenid period as the above account would seem to demonstrate they also show that by this time zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure one from an extremely distant past all of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with or even close to that of the achaemenids   later zoroastrian sources the pahlavi texts do provide an absolute chrono logy for zarathushtra one that was also accepted by some arab authors accord ing to these sources zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before alexander again scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification the most convincing arguments however seem to support the latter position the figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface because it represents in fact the more general one of 300 which was employed by sasanid propagandists to locate zarathushtras lifetime roughly around the beginning of iranian domination for a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the iranian chronology there was also a desire on the part of the sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat in this context zarathushtra whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos converted vishtaspa at the age of fortytwo and vishtaspas conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before alexander   given the unreliability of the few available sources we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements principally on the contention that zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before cyrus the great cambyses and darius as there is no mention in the avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western iran in the middle of the first millennium bce nor is there any mention of the history of that period which was to lead iran to a position of such predominance at the same time for a number of reasons going back much further in history would not be justified consequently the traditionally accepted theory of placing zara thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium bce appears to be the most legitimate   as to zarathushtras land of origin many scholars agree on the basis of valid arguments that he must have come from eastern iran some have held that he was a mede largely because of a late iranian tradition linking zarathushtra with azerbaijan but also because of linguistic reasons based on the language of the avesta this hypothesis however should be discarded as we can suppose both on historical and linguistic grounds that zarathushtra came from the east even though we do not know precisely from which region there is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter including the improbable view that he came from chorasmia or presentday khorezm or from a wider chorasmian region reaching as far as the oases of merv and herat most likely however zarathushtras land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the hindu kush mountain range to the more southern regions of bactria and arachosia modern qandahar as well as drangiana the area of lake helmand it would thus be located in what is now afghanistan or in the border regions of iran   zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste yasna 336 he was a zaotar cf sanskrit hotr that is a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry even in the socalled younger avesta he is described as an athravan yashts 1394 a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste to enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training which he used to lend dignity as in the gathas to the contents of his new message the product of a great and original ethical mind   zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition linking india to iran in another way by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan or possessor of asha that is the one who as in the vedic rtavan seeks truth and masters it thus becoming ashavan in this life  almost an initiate  and blessed after death any good follower of such teachings seeks the vision of asha just as those chosing the right path in vedic india aspired to the vision of the sun a manifestation of rta behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of aryan mysticism that is of indoiranian mysticism   zarathushtras greatness however does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition rather it lies in the innovation and strength of his message which was in itself a break in the tradition one that force fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas dualistic monotheism the wise lord who fathers two twin spirits the beneficent and the evil and the expectation of a transfiguration av frashokereti pahl frashgird of life and existence see frashokereti    both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate zarathushtras teachings from the indoiranian tradi tions of his upbringing they exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil because of his basic tenets zarathushtra who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi tion can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures   another original facet of zarathushtras message one that is not easy to understand but which however holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the gathas is the doctrine of the amesha spentas the beneficent immortals these are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought best truth desirable power bounteous devotion wholeness and immortality all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue see amesha spentas   other than the names of his father pourushaspa possessing gray horses and of his mother dughdova one who has milked we know almost nothing of zarathushtras life a late pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers according to tradition zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty and at thirty he was subject to a revelation both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision only after ten years had passed however did he succeed in converting a cousin of his maidhyoimah to his beliefs he was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis karapans and usijs priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices this hostility caused him to leave his region yasna 461 and to seek refuge at the court of kavi vishtaspa a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife hutaosa when the prophet according to tradition was fortytwo years old we also know the name of a son isat vastra desiring pastures and of three daughters born of his first wife as well as the names of two more sons urvatatnara commanding men and hvarecithra sunfaced born of his second wife hvovi a member of the influential hvogva possessing good cattle family two other figures belonging to the hvogva family are mentioned frashaoshtra and jamaspa the former as hvovis father and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet pouruchista very thoughtful whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the gathas yasna 53 again according to tradition zarathushtra died at the age of seventyseven he was assassinated by a karapan a priest of the old religion who belonged to the tuirya tribe and was called tur i bradres his name is known only in the pahlavi form   the paucity of information on the prophets life is compensated by a tradi tion rich in legendary detail that arose through the centuries in zoroastrian communities the main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the denkard a pahlavi work dating from the ninth century ce as well as passages from other pahlavi texts and a new persian work from the thirteenth century the zarathushtnama book of zarathushtra written by zaratushti bahrami pazhdu mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about zarathushtra which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man   zarathushtras great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the renaissance until the enlightenment during the classical and hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man a typical representative of an alien wisdom a master of the secrets of heaven and earth a seer astrologer psychologist and wonder worker pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of zarathushtra on pythagoras himself and the academicians always openly admired the persian thinker who founded the school of the magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism earliest christianity viewed zarathushtra as a precursor of the christian faith one who not only prophesied as had the biblical prophets the advent of the messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming the star that was to appear in the east and guide the three magi to the manger in bethlehem see magi this christian interpretation is derived from the zoroastrian doctrine of the saoshyant the savior of the future see saoshyant later however religious struggles arose during the sasanid empire in persia third to seventh centuries ce which linked the spread of christianity with the roman empire zarathushtras popularity in the christian world began to decline the iranian prophet who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by mani as one of the three great messengers from the past was now seen instead as a leader of imposture and heresy a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery but during the renaiss ance and the enlightenment european cultures reverted to the image of zara thushtra that had come down through classical and hellenistic antiquity he was viewed once again as a great and wise man as the author of the chaldean oracles and probably inventor of qabbalah as a teacher of astrology as a possible bridge between christianity and platonism and at times as in voltaire as a symbol of nonchristian wisdom   after western philology rediscovered zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries friedrich nietzsche in an intentional paradox gave the name zarathustra to the hero of his work also sprach zarathustra 1883 1892 nietzsche saw the iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things that is the eternal struggle between good and evil see also zoroastrianism ,3

into a bitbucket and vanished though appearing locally  ill repost it since i always feel slighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a conversational thread i dont want rob to think im doing so  since this is now dated however dont feel compelled to respond  in article 1993apr0817494245124watsonibmcom stromwatsonibmcom rob strom writes i was making two separate points both of which attack face value bible interpretation  1 to judge the bibles value today you judge it based on     the way it is used today  that is what do commentators     actually say what do rabbis teach etc  i suspect you meant this in context of the jewish tradition you have been referring to one problem with a highlyinterpreted tradition like this is what happens when a schism occurs and over time certain large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor exactly a face value interpretation  2 to judge the bibles value when originally written     you a read it in the context of its time not     with todays assumptions and b compare it to     the practices of surrounding people  while the context of the time is important value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding or at least to some base standard relative stabilitysuccess of a society eg  this is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people for instance according to the bible the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits  we need to look rather at what those peoples were really like  for instance in what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue  by the bibles own terms idolatry is inherently evil but i see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly bad people relative to the people in the bible  scissors and cloth now in the past our ancestors did cut cloth with scissors but they at least knew that their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from their earlier barbarism and made the transition to modern civilized papercutting that much easier  sounds good but it presupposes teethrending neighbors which i see no support for  one can argue that postfacto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points but that doesnt mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman  more to the point such dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain or even of a different people dwelling among us is all too common   that complex  and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic  interpretations of that history is interesting but i still dont  think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it  to attack condemnation of the original history  note that im speaking of historical interpretation here for instance claiming that hammurabis an eye for an eye was primitive brutal retribution while moses version was an enlightened benign fine because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way  as of 3000 years ago or so they probably both meant the same thing  to be sure im arguing from a parochial perspective i belong to this tiny tribe which has struggled against overwhelming odds for survival as a distinct tribe and this book is the book of my tribe  the book commands us to dedicate ourselves to study to improve the world and to set an example as a light to the nations  weve revered the book and i think weve been successful as scientists as artists and musicians as leaders in important humanitarian causes  its hard for me to separate the success of my people from the virtue of our book  youd have to argue that wed have done significantly better with a different book or with no book or that another tribe with a different book or with no book has done significantly better  i dont belittle the accomplishments particularly the intellectual ones of the jewish people  i have given up on trying to think by analogy since i dont know of any other tribe that is at all similar the closest i can think of are the romany but i dont know enough about them to make a meaningful comparison  i think a tradition of reflective study of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation is a good thing  i think that with such an attitude a case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a 1943 captain america comic or whatever the babylonian equivalent would have been   jim perry   perrydsinccom   decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions  for a nominal fee they can be yours     jim perry   perrydsinccom   decision support

might try contacting them if you already have idl   or would be willing to buy it  its a few thousand dollars american i   expect for idl and the other should be free  those are the general   purpose packages ive heard of besides what terramar has   sips was written for aviris imagery  im not sure how general purpose   it is  you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask  i   have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification you can compute an image using selected components  ive   used it on 70 megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best   speed you need an external dsp card  it will work without it but large   images take quite a while 5070 times as long to process  thats a   freebie if you want it    my  favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems   inc  idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its   programming language is very strong and easy  very pascallike it   handles the numbercrunching very well also personally i like doing   the numbercrunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even   excel on the mac if its not too hairy then bringing it over to nih   image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldnt handle and the speed and ease of use   compared to iraf was incredible by the way its mostly astronomical   image processing which ive been doing this means image enhancement   cleaning up bad linespixels and some other traditional image   processing routines then for example taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line i choose with the mouse then doing a curve   fit to that line which i might do like in kaleidagraph

written in c  the source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the office of grass   integration  you then compile the source code for your machine using   scripts provided with grass  i would recommend grass for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget grass is not very   userfriendly compared to macintosh software a first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines fft kelly maurice at vexcel corp in   boulder co is a primary user of grass   this gentleman has used the   grass software and developed multispectral 238 bands  volumetric   rendering full color on suns and stardents it was a really effective   interface  vexcel corp currently has a contract to map part of venus   and convert the magellan radar data into contour maps you can call them   at 303 4440094 or email care of gregvexcelcom 192929068    host configuration requirements    if you are willing to run aux you could install grass   on a macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data grass  is publicdomain and can run on a highend pc   under unix it is rasterbased has some imageprocessing capability   and can display vector data but analysis must be done in the raster   environment i have used grass v3 on a sun workstation and found it   easy to use it is best of course for data that are well represented   in raster gridcell form    availability    cerls

edge enhancing median   generic  complex histogramcontrast control  layer controller manages   up to 64 images at a time  user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands etc    the package is designed for a remote sensing application it can handle   very large images and there is all kinds of other software available   for gis applications   host configuration requirements    it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun   though there  were rumors there are always rumors that the software   would be  ported to pc and possibly a sun environment  pci    a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes   an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i   forget  the software is available in versions for msdos unix   workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly   other platforms by now  i use the vms version    the pci software consists of several classesgroupspackages of   utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci   database disk file  the tape io package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape   formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file   this is the only package i use or know much about  other packages can   display data from the pci database to one or another of several   pcisupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer eg an epsontype   dotmatrix graphics printer  you might be more spe cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and   fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg   multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store as channel 5 and   god only knows what all else  theres a lot  i dont have and dont   use these so cant say much about them you only buy the packages your   particular applicationinterest calls for    each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from   a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default   directory  some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations  the standard pci environment contains a   scripting language very similar to ibmpc basic but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  in vms i can also   invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure  theres   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the pci   data structures database file parameter file    the pci software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but   requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the   level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well  for instance the tape io package offers a   utility for reading headerless multiband what adobe photoshop on the   macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different   interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphicarts industrys ct2t format would probably i havent tried   handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what   youre doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start   over  its worth noting that the pci database file is designed to   contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of   other information i observe that a remotesensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude   longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this   can go into the pci database    i believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  on vax   systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific   thirdparty display systems the name goulddeanza seems to come to   mind  one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vctq qbus   24bit directcolor display subsystem  pci software could be overkill   in your case it seems designed for the very high end   applicationsusers ie those for whom a macpc largely doesnt suffice   although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  its   probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which   does a lot of its landresource management via remote sensing i believe   the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these   areas  spam spectral analysis manager    back in 1985 jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis   manager which got a fair amount of use at the time  that was designed   for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data  256 pixels   across by  512 lines by  256 bands a modified version has since   been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging   spectrometer which uses much larger images    spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and   ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays   actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   stretching  spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering    the original spam uses x or sunview to display  the aviris version may   require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame   buffer  i can refer you to people if youre interested  pcw requires x   for display  map ii    among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley  clrview    clrview is a

article 1993apr1804320727862dcswarwickacuk   simondcswarwickacuk simon clippingdale writes  alarming amounts of agreement deleted    i made my statement about ockums razor from my experiences in physics   thanks for info in baysian statistics  very interesting and i didnt  know it before i follow your proof but i have one questions we have  two hypotheses h and hg  the latter is more complicated which by  definition means ph  phg  that complicated isnt in fact where ph  phg comes from its more the other way around its from    ph    phg   phg  where g is the complement of g  and by axiom panything  0 so phg  0 so ph  phg  in a sense hg is necessarily more complicated than h for any h and g so i may be splitting hairs but what im trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is ph  phg holds with equality if and only if phg  0   as you point out its a very simple matter to show px  h  px  hg   ph  x  phg  x and thus h is to be preferd to hg now to say  that h is as consistent with the data as hg is to say px  h   px  hg  can you elaborate some on this  well px  a  px  b means that x is as likely to be observed if a is operative as it is if b is operative this implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that a and b are operative the difference reduces to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior probabilities pa and pb    px  a  px  b        pa  x    k pa   and   pb  x    k pb  where k    px  a  px    px  b  px  so a and b are equally consistent with the data in that observing x doesnt give any pointers as to which of a or b is operative  in the particular case where a  h and b  hg however we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by ph  phg although we dont know the actual values and its this which allows us to deploy the razor to throw out any such hg   also in the real world it isnt as clear cut and dry it seems   to me we cant always determine whether the equality px  h     px  hg is true   thats certainly true but the particular point here was whether or not a divine component actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of spreading the word  now it seems to me as ive said that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model but rather less well if one proposes a divine component in addition since i would expect the latter to conspire against wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs thus my personal feeling is that px  hg isnt even equal to px  h in this case but is smaller h is memetic transmission g is divine component x is the variance among beliefs but i happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression   btw my beef with your baysian argument was not a mathematical one    i checked most of your work and didnt find an error and you seem very    careful so there probably isnt a math mistake i think the mistake  is philosophical but just to make sure i understand you can please   rephrase it in nontechnical terms i think this is a reasonable   request  i always try to look for ways of  explaining physics to   nonphysicist im not a baysian statistician nor any type of   statistician so this would be very helpful   not that im a statistician as such either but  the idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the read my observations to date however theism of the type with which i am concerned also suggests that for instance prayer may be answered people may be miraculously healed both are in principle amenable to statistical verification and that gods may generally intervene in measurable ways  this means that these regions of the space of possible observations  which i loosely termed appearances of gods have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic  since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism expends on making appearances of gods possible must come from somewhere else ie other possible observations  all else being equal this means that an observation which isnt an appearance of gods must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism the bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis  sorry if thats still a bit jargonesque but its rather difficult to put it any other way since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities and particularly that the total area under them is always unity  an analogy may or may not  be helpful say that hypothesis a is the coin is fair and that b is the coin is unfair twoheaded ive used a and b to avoid confusion with hheads and ttails  then    ph  a  05    total 1   pt  a  05      ph  b  1      total 1   pt  b  0      the observations are a string of heads with no tails this is compatible with both a fair coin a and a twoheaded coin b however the probability expended by a on making possible the appearance of tails even though they dont actually appear must come from somewhere else since the total must be unity and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads  say our running estimates at time n1 are en1a and en1b the observation xn at time n is another head xn  h the estimates are modified according to                              ph  a   ena      en1a        en1a  m                               ph  and                              ph  b   enb      en1b        en1b  2m                               ph  now we dont know ph the actual prior probability of a head but the multiplier for ea is half that for eb this is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed  thus whatever the initial values of the estimates after n heads we have                   n   ena      m  e0a  and                     n   enb      2m  e0b  and since eka  ekb  1 at any time k you can show that 05  m  1 and thus 1  2m  2 hence the estimate for the faircoin hypothesis a must decrease at each trial and that for the twoheaded coin hypothesis b must increase even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads  the loose analogy is between unfair coin and atheism and between fair coin and theism with observations consistent with both a tail which would falsify unfair coin is analogous to an appearance of gods which would falsify atheism i am not claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities just that the principle is the same   constant observation of no evidence for gods if evidence for them                                                    is at all possible under the respective theisms constantly increases     the notional estimated probability that they dont exist    its important to draw a distinction between theism that could  be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that cant  given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible  it doesnt make sense to say lack of evidence supports the contrary   view  quite so but this type of theism is what i might call the g in the hg in terms of our ockhams razor discussion and id bin it on those grounds   so it depends upon your conception of this god if its a conception   like zeus who happened to come down to earth to play quite   frequently then i agree with you  lack of evidence for this conception   of god is evidence that it does not exist but if your conception  of god is one that does not make falsifiable predictions see below  on falsifiable predictions then i disagree  lack of evidence  does not support a disbelief   the hypotheses dont have to be falsifiable and indeed in my model the theism isnt falsifiable      i used the phrase should obverse given any specific x theism   does not make the prediction px  ht  0 thats why i used the   word should  theism makes no predictions about any specific event  i can only say i believe that god did such and such after such  and such happens or i believe god will do such and such but  for any given x i can never a priori say px  ht  0 i can  not even say this for the set of all x or some x this is what   dont like about your use of probability we also have no way of  assigning these probabilities  i hold science to positivistic  criteria  if someone cannot tell me how to measure even in principle  px  h then probability is not applicable to hypothesis h such  is the case when h  ht theistic and ha atheistic for example  px  ha  px  hapha what is pha how do i measure it   you dont have to we dont need in the above analogy to know any prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the faircoin hypothesis is less than unity and that the corresponding multiplier for the twoheaded coin hypothesis is greater than unity you dont need to know the initial values of the running estimates either its clear that after a large number of observations pfaircoin approaches zero and ptwoheadedcoin approaches unity  all you need to know is whether px  ha is larger than px  ht for observed x and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered possible not necessary under ht which are not possible under ha and all else is equal   baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations but  what if the hypothesis isnt amenable to observation and even for  statements that are amenable to observation some observations are  not relevant  a sequence of observations must be chosen with care  im curious to know what types of observations x1x2 you have   in mind concerning theism and atheism  any observations you like it really doesnt matter nor affect the reasoning provided that there are some possible observations which would count as appearances of gods examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer or of the veracity of revelation   but any statement about px  h for general x still counts as a   prediction of h if the theism in question ht says that prayer may   be answered or that miracles may happen see my interpretation quoted   again above of what god exists means then this is a prediction   px  ht  0 for such x its what distinguishes it from the atheist   hypothesis ha which predicts that this stuff does not happen px  ha   0 for such x   theism does not make the claim that px  ht  0 for such x  or i should say that my theism doesnt maybe i was too quick to  say we had a common language you said that by the existence of god   you mean the notion that the deity described by the bible and by   christians does interact with the universe as claimed by those agents  i agreed with this however i must be careful here i believe  this  im not making any claims maybe i should have changed does  to can  there is an important shift of emphasis but any way  since i only have a belief i cannot conclude px  ht  0 for   such x  ok well downgrade does interact to may interact which would actually be better since does interact implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced   i dont think my theism makes predictions maybe im not  understanding what you mean by prediction  could you explain what  you mean by this word  ill explain but bear in mind that this isnt central all i require of a theism is that it not make the prediction appearances of gods will never happen as does atheism before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesnt make this prediction either the difference is that qm and atheism do not form a partition  predictions include such statements as prayer is efficacious implying if you do the stats you will find that prayer is efficacious or prayer is not efficacious or verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled i dont think we have any problems of misunderstanding here   persistent observation of this stuff not happening consistent with  ht though it may be is more consistent with ha as explained in the  bayesian stats post    even if ht god exists is unfalsifiable thats  no problem for my argument other than that you have to let the number   of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically    btw i do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of   observations as valid  or rather that part of the argument is not valid   we as existing humans can never make an infinite number of measurments   and any conclusion that reilies on this i dont accept as valid  thats fine i dont claim that theism is false merely that the finite number of observations available to me so far suggest that it is and that as i continue to observe the suggestion looks better and better   renormalization stuff deleted   in the bayesian stats post i assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable  in a finite number of observations heres the relevant quote     the important assumption is that there are some observations which    are compatible with the theist hypothesis and not with the atheist    hypothesis and thus would falsify atheism these are what i called   appearances of gods but this need not be taken too literally any    observation which requires for its explanation that one or more gods    exist will count all other observations are assumed to be compatible    with both hypotheses this leaves theism as unfalsifiable and atheism    as falsifiable in a single observation only by such appearances of    gods   here is my problem with this for something to be falsifiable it  must make the prediction that x should not be seen if x is   seen then the hypothesis has been falsified now atheism is a word   in oposition to something  theism a theism aserts a  belief and an   atheism aserts a disbelief so there are certain atheisms that are   certainly falsifiable  just as there are certain theisms that are   falsifable eg if my theism asserts the world is only 6000 years   old and that god does not decieve then this has been falsified however   the atheism that is in oposition to an unfalsifiable theism is also   unfalsifiable i could be wrong on this statment  contd  i think you are an appearance of gods is sufficient to falsify atheism whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable   ill think more about it until then here is a general question  suppse x were unfalsifiable is notx also unfalsifiable   no by way of a counterexample let x  the coin is fair or more accurately so that notx makes sense the two sides of the coin are different this is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify x in the limit its converse is falsifiable and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared   this is partly whats wrong with you baysian argument  which   requires observations x1  xn to be made there are simply   no such observations that have a truth value in relation to the   statement god exists now by use of your symmetry argument i   can understand why someone would say since the statement   god does not exist      makes no predictions i will choose not to believe it but none  the less this would be founded on a type of faith  or if you dont  like the word faith insert belief for which there is no falsifiable  evidence instead    ill assume you meant god exists up there at the highlight but by our  agreed definition of exists the statement makes predictions as i said  above although it isnt falsifiable in a finite number of observations   actually i mean god does not exist makes no predictions  oops sorry mea culpa   the truth of this statment actually depends upon which god you are  refering to but i can think of some conceptions of god for which   it is true but once again im open to the posibility that i could  be wrong so give me some examples of predictions of the statment  god does not exist here is one that i can think of if true then   there would be no healing or miricles but this can in principle never   be determined one way or the other there are cases in which people   seem to recover and are healed without the help of a doctor and for no    known reason these situations do in fact happen they are consistent  with a theistic hypothesis but in no way support such a hypothesis  we agree here   they are not inconsistent with an atheistic hypothesis i cant  think of one prediction from god does not exist that isnt of  this type but i might be missing something   the rapture will not happen on october 28 1992 said rapture would have falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened although its failure to happen does not of course falsify any theisms other than those which specifically predicted it  no phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its explanation will ever be observed that about sums the whole thing up   bob singleton  bobsthnextmitedu  cheers  simon   simon

controversial nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions misstatements or misconceptions and post them to the net  in addition people often request information which has been posted time and time again  in order to try and cut down on this the altatheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles     1  altatheism faq overview for new readers    2  altatheism faq introduction to atheism    3  altatheism faq frequently asked questions faq    4  altatheism faq constructing a logical argument    5  altatheism faq atheist resources

 the articles titled a primer on how to work with the usenet community answers to frequently asked questions about usenet and hints on writing style for usenet are particularly relevant  questions concerning how news works are best asked in newsnewusersquestions  if you are unable to find any of the articles listed above see the finding stuff section below

596,596,from gorgenannarborappliconslbcom david gorgen subject need help zbuffering lines  areas together organization applicon inc ann arbor mi usa keywords zbuffer roundoff lines areas lines 84  im asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in zbuffering that ive encountered in 2 different pex implementations  i cant find any discussion of this problem in any resources i can lay hands on eg the compwindowsxpex faq gaskinss pexlibprogrammingmanual vendors documentation  im posting this article by itself on compgraphics and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on compwindowsxpex  the problem is hard to describe without pictures hence this article is longish  if you can run pexlib 5x programs and are interested i encourage you to build and run the test program in compwindowsxpex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it  it depends on the utility code from the above gaskins book instructions for fetching it via anonymous ftp are given  the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching artifacts resulting from the use of zbuffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas  the interpolated z values along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area  because of this its a tossup whether the zbuffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed visually the result tends to be a dashedline effect even though the line is supposed to be solid  using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one for the areas and one for the lines  the pex structures or immediate mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines  the result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines  this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards ie smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas  this means that when a point is transformed to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias  i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the zbuffer typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 ie 16 or 24 bit zbuffers therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching  but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0003 to 0006 of the range  empirically its worst when the npc z component of the slope of the surface is high ie when it appears more or less edgeon to the viewer  its as if only 8 or 9 bits of the zbuffer have any dependable meaning  this amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through areas which they are supposed to lie behind  ive observed the problem on both hewlettpackard and digital workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree  the test program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 5x implementation this version is known to compile and run on an hpux system with pex 51  open questions     1 why does this happen           am i configuring the pex view table wrongly           is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines             as opposed to areas eg pixel centers versus corners which             could be corrected for           are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their             interpolators           something else     2 what to do about it           can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision             in zbuffered hlhsr           is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching             artifacts           am i just out of luck  any help would be immensely appreciated     dave gorgen                         internet gorgenannarborappliconslbcom applicon inc                                 gorgenaaaca1sinetslbcom ann arbor michigan usa               uucp uunetsharkeyapplgagorgen ,1

1r0sn03rhorusapmchpsnide frankd012s658uucp frank odwyer writes   theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism   deletion   theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it  imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered   bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor     gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators  and the really dangerous people  the sources of fanaticism  are often none of these things  they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing   thats a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say     now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you  to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument  and it reads to me like a warmup for censorship and restriction of religious freedom  ever read animal farm    thats a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism   gullibility by the way is one of them     and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer     2  define irrational belief  eg is it rational to believe that      reason is always useful   irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information  well there is a glaring paradox here  an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational  which is it    thats bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed   your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular     the first part of the second statement contains no information because you dont say what the beliefs are  if the beliefs are strong theism andor strong atheism then your statement is not in general true  the second part of your sentence is patently false  counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it    ive been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here   an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way   further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms   what is it you are trying to say     compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational  i cant agree with this until you are specific  which theism  to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have    using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals andor the way the world works     the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis  i dont understand this  can you formalise your argument   person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste  of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekitesidolatersprotestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects   answer the question what the absolute set of morals is people agree on like they would agree on a football being a football    benedikt ,0

to specify your correct email address to reply to      1  what is jpeg  jpeg pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 1bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   2  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 24bitperpixel color data instead of 8bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 2 mbyte fullcolor file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 24 bitspixel 16 million colors instead of 8 or less 256 or fewer colors  if you have only 8bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 8bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 7 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   3  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 24bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 7 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 256 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 14 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   4  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 727x525 fullcolor

file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   5  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 95 does not mean keep 95 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 75 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 75 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 95 saying q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 95 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 50 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 75 is about right for compressing 24bit images but q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting gifs see section 14 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right  q 2 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   6  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   6a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  xv shareware 25 is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats  it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu 1824012 file contribxv300tarz  version 300 is a major upgrade with support for 24bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking  if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 221 also available from export  note that version 221 is not a good choice if you have a 24bit display youll get only 8bit color nor for converting 24bit images to jpeg  but 221 works fine for converting gif and other 8bit images to jpeg  caution there is a glitch in version 221 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 24bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 303  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage303tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 303 is using a hackedover v1  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli114tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 24bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os2 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 25 is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 129975050 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg25zip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386486 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 12 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv12zip  hiview requires a 386 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm386 and 386max work windows and os2 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 30  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 21 available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview21zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv2zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 860a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 25  available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw860azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic50 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg4zip or jpeg4386zip if you have a 386 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 6b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif2jpgjpg2gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 24bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 20 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif2jpg2zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy  this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats  it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 162 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsalch162zip  note about simtel20 the internets key archive site for pcrelated programs is simtel20 full name wsmrsimtel20armymil 1928811020  simtel20 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel20 that really means pd1msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel20 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 14121010117 which keeps simtel20 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel20 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 10 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 31 and 256ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version 09 is available from ftpcicaindianaedu 129792084 file pubpcwin3desktopjview090zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchivewustledu  winjpeg shareware 20 displays jpeggiftargatiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and slideshow  the current version is 21 available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows3winjp210zip  this is a slow 286compatible version if you register youll get the 386only version which is roughly 25 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 30  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 097 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin3desktopcview097zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos  dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in fullscreen mode not in a window  os2  the following files are available from hobbesnmsuedu 12812335151

installed to use quicktime you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running system 607 or later  if youre running system 6 you must also install the 32bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 7  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 1192 this file contains quicktime 15 which is better than qt 10 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 15  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 10 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 20 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 364406 file infomacappjpegview20hqx  requires system 7 and quicktime  on 8bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 40 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 232  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter232hqx  requires system 605 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert10hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v06 a jpeggif converter based on an old version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt10stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 7 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 32bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress201hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 32bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 201 or later can read and write jfifformat jpeg files use the jpeg plugin from the acquire menu  you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it  amiga  most programs listed in this

have fullcolor 24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 8bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 256orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 256 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 256color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 256 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 256color gif on a 16color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan8bit display hardware already 15bit hicolor pc displays true 24bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   8  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart13  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   9  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 100 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v4 free jpeg code you can also say sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 6 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   10  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 60 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 60 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 6a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 11 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif2jpgjpg2gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   11  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  1  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d8 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 10 followed by jfif  2  if you see ff d8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  3  hsi files start with hsi1  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  4  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it  5  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d8     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  9begin line 9mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  9begin line 9mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   12  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   13  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    14  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 3 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 12 or 13rd the size of the gif file not 14th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 75 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v4 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 10 or so when converting gifs values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 85 smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg group at jpeginfouunetuunet    999tom lane 999organizer

pages isbn paper 034529887x  richard swinburne  the existence of god revised edition clarendon paperbacks oxford this book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with the coherence of theism 1977 and was concluded with faith and reason 1981  in this work swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of god  his arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western christian values and aesthetics to a god which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were decisively rejected in mackies the miracle of theism  in the revised edition of the existence of god swinburne includes an appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut mackie  j l mackie  the miracle of theism oxford this posthumous volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of god  it ranges from the classical philosophical positions of descartes anselm berkeley hume et al through the moral arguments of newman kant and sidgwick to the recent restatements of the classical theses by plantinga and swinburne  it also addresses those positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational such as those of kierkegaard kung and philips as well as replacements for god such as lelies axiarchism  the book is a delight to read  less formalistic and better written than martins works and refreshingly direct when compared with the handwaving of swinburne  james a haught  holy horrors an illustrated history of religious murder and madness

                       ninety to a hundred years ago everybody knew that a            heavierthanair machine could not possibly fly  it would            violate the laws of physics  all of the experts and            authorities said so                            for example simon newcomb declared in 1901  the            demonstration that no possible combination of known            substances known forms of machinery and known forms of            force can be united in a practical machine by which man            shall fly long distances through the air seems to the writer            as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any            physical fact to be                            fortunately a few smart people such as the wright            brothers did not accept such pronouncements as the final            word  now we take airplanes for granted except when they            crash                            today orthodox physicists and other scientists are            saying similar things against several kinds of free energy            technologies using negative terms such as pseudoscience            and perpetual motion and citing socalled laws which            assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed 1st law            of thermodynamics and there is always a decrease in useful            energy 2nd law of thermodynamics  the physicists do not            know how to do certain things so they arrogantly declare            that those things cannot be done  such principles of            impotence are common in orthodox modern science and help to            cover up inconsistencies and contradictions in orthodox            modern theories                            free energy inventions are devices which can tap a            seemingly unlimited supply of energy from the universe with           out burning any kind of fuel making them the perfect            solution to the worldwide energy crisis and its associated            pollution degradation and depletion of the environment                            most free energy devices probably do not create energy            but rather tap into existing natural energy sources by            various forms of induction  unlike solar or wind devices            they need little or no energy storage capacity because they            can tap as much energy as needed when needed  solar energy            has the disadvantage that the sun is often blocked by            clouds trees buildings or the earth itself or is reduced            by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and            high latitudes  likewise wind speed is widely variable and            often nonexistent  neither solar nor wind power are            suitable to directly power cars and airplanes  properly            designed free energy devices do not have such limitations                            for example at least three us patents 3811058            3879622 and 4151431 have so far been awarded for            motors that run exclusively on permanent magnets seemingly            tapping into energy circulating through the earths magnetic            field  the first two require a feedback network in order to            be selfrunning  the third one as described in detail in            science  mechanics magazine spring 1980 amazing            magnetpowered motor by jorma

inventor joseph newman see science 21084 pages            5712 taps electromagnetic energy by induction from            earth resonance about 12 cycles per second plus            harmonics  they typically have a spark gap in the circuit            which serves to synchronize the energy in the coils with the            energy being tapped  it is important that the total            inductance and capacitance of the device combine to            resonate at the same frequency as earth resonance in            order to maximize the power output  this output can also be            increased by centering the spark gap at the neutral center            of a strong ushaped permanent magnet  in the case of a            tesla coil slipping a toroid choke coil around the            secondary coil

during the 1930s an austrian civil engineer named            viktor schauberger invented and partially developed an            implosion turbine german name zokwendle after            analyzing erosion and lack of erosion in differently shaped            waterways and developing sophisticated mathematical            equations to explain it  as described in the book a            breakthrough to new freeenergy sources by dan a davidson            1977 water is pumped by an impeller pump through a            logarithmicspiralshaped coil of tubing until it reaches a            critical velocity  the water then implodes no longer            touching the inside walls of the tubing and drives the pump            which then converts the pumps motor into an electric            generator  the device seems to be tapping energy from that            of the earths rotation via the coriolis effect like a            tornado   it can also neutralize gravity                             a fourth type of free energy device is the mcclintock            air motor us patent 2982261 which is a cross between            a diesel engine it has three cylinders with a compression            ratio of 27 to 1 and a rotary engine with solar and            planetary gears  it burns no fuel but becomes selfrunning            by driving its own air compressor  this engine also            generates a lot of heat which could be used to heat            buildings and its very high torque makes it ideal for large            trucks preventing their slowing down when climbing hills             david mcclintock is also the real original inventor of the            automatic transmission differential and 4wheel drive                            crystals may someday be used to supply energy as shown            in the star trek shows perhaps by inserting each one between            metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of            particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a            common household smoke detector                            one other energy source should be mentioned here            despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of free            energy  a bulgarianborn american physicist named joseph            maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic fusion            reactor which he calls migma which uses nonradioactive            deuterium as a fuel available in nearly unlimited quantities            from sea water does not produce radioactive waste can be            converted directly into electricity without energywasting            steam turbines and can be constructed small enough to power            a house or large enough to power a city  and unlike the            tokamaks and laser fusion monstrosities that we read about            migma works already producing at least three watts of power            for every watt put in  new times us version 62678            pages 3240                            and then there are the cold fusion experiments that            have been in the news lately originally conducted by            university of utah researchers b stanley pons and martin            fleischmann  some us navy researchers at the china lake            naval weapons center in california under the direction of            chemist melvin miles finally took the trouble to collect the            bubbles coming from such an apparatus had them analyzed with            massspectrometry techniques and found helium 4 which            proves that atomic fusion did indeed take place and enough            of it to explain the excess heat generated                            there are good indications that the two socalled laws            of thermodynamics are not so absolute  for example the            late physicist dewey b larson developed a comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe which he            calls the reciprocal system which he describes in detail            in several books such as nothing but motion 1979 and the            universe of motion 1984 in which the physical universe            has two distinct halves the material half and an antimatter            half with a continuous cycle of matter and energy passing            between them without the heat death predicted by            thermodynamic laws  his theory explains the universe much            better than modern orthodox theories including phenomena            that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about and is selfconsistent in every way  some            free energy devices might be tapping into that energy flow            seemingly converting lowquality energy into highquality            energy                            also certain religious organizations such as sant mat            and eckankar teach their members that the physical universe            is only the lowest of at least a dozen major levels of            existence like parallel universes or analogous to tv            channels as described in books like the path of the            masters by dr julian johnson 1939 and eckankar the key            to secret worlds by sri paul twitchell 1969  for example            the next level up from the physical universe is commonly            called the astral plane  longtime members of these groups            have learned to soul travel into these higher worlds and            report on conditions there  it seems plausible that energy            could flow down from these higher levels into the physical            universe or be created at the boundary between them given            the right configuration of matter to channel it  this is            supported by many successful laboratorycontrolled            experiments in psychokinesis throughout the world such as            those described in the book psychic discoveries behind the            iron curtain                            in terms of economics the market has failed  inventors            do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop            and massproduce free energy equipment and the conventional            energy producer have no desire to do so because of their            veted interet  the government is needed to intervene  if            the government does not intervene then the total supply of            energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and            will soon run out prices for energy will increase and            pollution and its harmful effects including the greenhouse            effect acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil            spills rape of the land by strip mining etc will continue            to increase                            the government should subsidize research and development            of free energy by inventors and universities subsidize            private production until the producers can make it on their            own and subsidize consumption by lowincome consumers of            free energy hardware                            the longrange effects of such government intervention            would be widespread and profound  the quantity of energy            demanded from conventional energy producer coal mining            companie oil companie and countries electric utilitie            etc would drop to near zero forcing their employees to            seek work elsewhere  energy resources coal uranium oil            and gas would be left in the ground  prices for            conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero            while the price of free energy equipment would start out high            but drop as supply increases as happened with vcrs            personal computers etc  costs of producing products that            require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease            along with their prices to consumers  consumers would be            able to realize the opportunity costs of paying electric            utility bills or buying home heating fuel  tourism would            benefit and increase because travelers would not have to            spend their money for gasoline for their cars  government            tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be            obtained in some other way  and energy could no longer be            used as a motive or excuse for making war                            many conventional energy producer would go out of            business but society as a whole and the earths environment            and ecosystems would benefit greatly  it is the people            that government should serve rather than the big            corporation and

9your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic  but to do so is absolutely useless now  if you had wanted to get right with god before the rapture you could have but you chose to wait  now your  only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the  tribulation  but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be  saved  matthew 2413  ii realize you are now living during the great tribulation  9the great tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until christs second coming  also know as the time of jacobs israels trouble jere 307 and daniels seventieth week dan 9 this  period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror  iii gather as many bibles as you can and hide them  9soon after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community  the revived roman empire bibles will be confiscated and owning a bible will be tantamount to treason  the bible however will be your most valuable  possession during the tribulation  iv read the bible like you have never read it before in your life  9since all of your bibles may be confiscated even if you are careful it is imperative that you read the word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them  it is especially important to read daniel luke 21 matthew 24  revelation and amos for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you    v pray like you have never prayed before in your life  9pray until the power of god comes strongly upon you  pray and pray  and pray  only by reading the word and praying will you gain the spiritual  strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of christ    vi do not take the mark at any cost  even in fit means you and your loved ones die as martyrs  9after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community he will institute a world economic system designed so that you cannot buy sell or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name  money will be useless  and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and  slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast  or the number of his name  here is wisdom  let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a man his number is 666  revelation 131618   9the antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of  humanity  think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past such as the holocaust or maybe the crusades m you cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the antichrists rule it will be much worse than anything in history matt 2421 i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held  and a white robe was given to each of  them and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer  until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren who would be killed as they were was completed revelation 69 11 9his targets will be jews and christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn and i saw the souls of  those who had been beheaded for their witness to jesus and for the word of  god who had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands  revelation 204  he will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce christ  nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you even your children  torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark   9if you take the mark or worship the antichrist or his image however you will be consigned to the second death which is the lake of fire sung about so eloquently by johnny cashm you cannot be redeemed  it is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then sic to endure eternal torment in the ringhhhh lake of fire  if anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his  mark on his forehead or on his hand he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out full strength into the cup of his  indignation  an sic he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the  presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb revelation  14910   and probably in the presence of seasonticket holders special hats given to the first 5000 at the stadium m   vii set a plan in motion for survival  9although you may not be able to hide from the antichrists government until the end of the tribulation all of the time you gain in hiding is  important for your spiritual growth and strengthening since only those who are extremely strong in christ can suffer and die for his sake 9the first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area for the antichrists control will come last to the least populated areas  take a good radio or tv with you so that you can stay  attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the tribulation as you can see on the weather map heavy currents of tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak  expect delays on i95 outbound and perhaps school closings m  store water and food because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark  water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood get a good water filter m bring different types of clothing for all seasons as well as flashlights batteries generators and first aid supplies  in short learn how to  survive and live off the land as the pioneers did  viii trust no one 9 9there will be secret agents everywhere spying for the antichrists government  be on the lookout perot supporters take note m  ix watch for the antichrist  9it is important to realize who the antichrist is and what he is up to for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it  we can infer from daniel  11 certain characteristics of this man  popular during the first three and a half years of the tribulation he will dominate the airwaves  he will be  physically appealing highly intelligent with christlike charisma and  personality  an international politician military tactician and economic expert his word will be peace he will make a treaty with the jews which he will break after three and a half years  he will have such supernatural  power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed  even the very elect will be deceived  if you do not pray and read the bible you too will be deceived dominate the airwaves  perhaps howard stern or rush limbaughm 9the antichrist will have a companion the false prohphet sic who will make an image in the likeness of the antichrist and cause it to speak   all who refuse to worhsip sic the image will be killed  the final three and a half years will be absolutely insane with demonized spirits everywhere  x do not give up hope  9the seven years of tribulation will end with the triumphant return of christ  the antichrist will be defeated  be steadfast and endure and you  will be rewarded greatly in heaven   9start reading the bible and praying fervently now  the salvation of  your sould depends upon it  determine that come what may you will not take the mark or worship the antichrist  you still have a chance to be saved or remain saved but this time you will have to be faithful unto death  9may god find you ready in the hour of his glorious return   mike cluff9999  christianity is stupid v22964qsubvms or mikeluickubvms9   give up negativland ub language perception

810,810,from davebpogowvtekcom dave butler subject re is it good that jesus died organization tektronix inc wilsonville  or lines 169  brian ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of false dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to peter or we must discount every other book of antiquity  1 peter died two millenia ago  the original letters he wrote have long since decayed into dust  if he were alive today and i could    do you question the existence of alexander the great tilgrath pilisar iii  nero caligula josephus cyrus the great artexerxes   their documents  have decayed to dust too  brian why another excuse   mr ceccarelli you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every historical document  somehow i doubt do that yourself that  thus since i doubt you accept everything written in every historical document i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to peter   i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity which i am sure you reject it dates from the time of ramses ii this was first presented here by matthew wiener  these inscriptions were carved soon after a battle and were carved with the pharoahs specific approval so we have true originals rather than mere copies  this account records the the battle of kadesh circa 1285 bc which occurred on the river orontes about 100 miles south of aleppo  the egyptians won this battle with the hittites and ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place  a few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form  it is a record of how the pharoah pretty much singlehandedly defeated the hittites after being separated from his troops   note that the egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person  the following is from miriam lichtheims ancient egyptian literature volume ii  9my majesty caused the forces of the foes from hitti to fall 9on their faces one upon the other as crocodiles fall into 9the water of the orontes  i was after them like a griffin 9i attacked all the countries i alone  for my infantry and 9my chariotry had deserted me not one of them stood looking 9back  as i live as ra loves me as my father atum favors 9me everything that my majesty has told i did it in truth 9in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry  note this paragraph records not only ramses divine word but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event  now from the heart of  battle  9then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces 9of the foe from hitti being alone by himself none other 9with him  his majesty proceeded to look about him and 9found 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out   9no officer was with me no charioteer 9no soldier of the army no shieldbearer 9my infantry my chariotry yielded before them 9not one of them stood firm to fight with them 9his majesty spoke what is this father amun 9is it right for a father to ignore his son 9are my deeds a matter for you to ignore 9do i not walk and stand at your word 9i have not neglected an order you gave 9too great is he the great lord of egypt 9to allow aliens to step on his path 9what are these asiatics to you o amun 9the wretches ignorant of god 9have i not made for you many great monuments 9 9i call to you my father amun 9i am among a host of strangers 9all countries are arrayed against me 9i am alone theres none with me 9 9the labors of many people are nothing 9amun is more helpful than they 9i came here by the command of your mouth 9o amun i have not transgressed your command  9now though i prayed in a distant land 9my voice resounded in southern thebes 9i found amun came when i called to him 9he gave me his hand and i rejoiced 9he called from behind as if near by 9forward i am with you 9i your father my hand is with you 9i prevail over a hundred thousand men 9i am lord of victory lover of valor 9i found my heart stout my breast in joy 9all i did succeeded i was like mont 9 9i slaughtered among them at my will 9not one looked behind him 9not one turned around 9whoever fell down did not rise 9 9one called out to the other saying 9no man is he who is among us 9it is seth greatofstrength baal in person 9not deeds of man are these his doings 9they are of one who is unique 9who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots 9come quick flee before him 9to seek life and breathe air 9for he who attempts to get close to him 9his hands all his limbs grow limp 9one cannot hold either bow or spears 9when one sees him come racing along 9my majesty hunted them like a griffin 9i slaughtered among them unceasingly  so you see brian we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous  battle between the ramses and the hittites  do you reject them as being completely true i suspect you do and if so then do you also in your own words       question the existence of alexander the great tilgrath pilisar iii      nero caligula josephus cyrus the great artexerxes  do you also thereby question all their documents thats the problem with your all or nothing approach  many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy with their facts  so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter and the rest of the new testament or accept no records of antiquity at all forces you thereby to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find completely credible   as to your other argument that so many people have testified to jesus that he must be true   are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness   are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from  shepherds to irs agents to royal officials to kings to computer  programmers fiction  with a scoff of your keyboard with near  complete ignorance of the testimonies are you going to say that  that is all complete hooey   would that not be the most audacious  display of arrogance  do you actually think you know better than  king solomon king david or even abraham lincoln   i have three points    first this is argumentum ad populum ie appeal to popular opinion you cannot vote on truth  for instance do the millions of hindus past and present who testify to the reality of brahma constitute actual evidence for the existence of brahma how would you answer your own question in regards to the testimony of hindus  9with a scoff of your keyboard with near complete ignorance of  9 the testimonies are you going to say that that is all complete  9 hooey  if you do so scoff then how do you objectively justify your own special pleading  second it is not at all clear that king solomon or king david testified to jesus  you can claim it to be clear but that does not make it true   third it is quite arguable that abraham lincoln was not christian and that he had both a public and a private view of christianity  in fact there was much discussion about it in his day yes he was publically accused of being a deist  oh my  i am presently collecting a faq for lincoln as ive previously done for tyre jefferson and etc    9999later  9999dave butler      my earlier views of the unsoundness of the christian scheme of       salvation and the human origin of the scriptures have become       clearer and stronger with advancing years and i see no reason for       thinking i shall ever change

the       place and were listening to bds conversations till the very end        koreshs attorney claims that based on some 30 hours he spent      talking to his client and others in the compound he saw no      indication that bds were contemplating suecide        the survivors claim it was not a suecide    its not clear that more than one of the survivors made this claim  it is  clear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim that  bd members had started the fire  no this is far from clear  we only have the word of the fbi spokepeople that a survivor made this claim  we have the contradictory word of the lawyers who spoke with the survivors individually that all of them agreed that they did not have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire  in the absense of any more evidence i dont see how we can decide who to believe furthermore its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else with the state of the area now we may never know what happened         bds were not contemplating suecide and there is no reason       to believe they committed one    no reason  how about these two    1  some of the survivors claimed that bd members poured fuel along the  9corridors and set fire to it  the speed at which the fire spread  9is not inconsistent with this claim  again we have only the word of the fbi on this claim  the lawyers who have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim     2  there was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound  9there is a very very good possibility that the fbi did not start this  9fire  this is a good reason to believe that the bds did  i will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities  its more likely that the bds started the fire than did the fbi  but there is currently no way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence which is nearly none     3  even if the bds were not contemplating suicide it is very possible that  9david koresh was convinced and thus convinced the others that this  9was not suicide  it was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort    there are three possibilities other than the bds self destruction    a  they are not dead but escaped via bunkeretc  from reports of the  9inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found i would rate this  9as highly unlikely    b  the fire was started by an fbi accident  this is possible but it would be  9foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it  9sure its possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern  9which started the fire why was there a lit lantern in the middle of  9the day near the edge of the complex  its anecdotal evidence that  9has been contradicted by other escapees    c  the fire was started on purpose by the fbi  this has been suggested by  9some on the net and i would rate this possibility as utterly  9ludicrous  this is what we in sciskeptic would call an  9extraordinary claim and wont bother refuting unless someone gives  9any good evidence to back it up     d   the fire was an started accidentally by the bds  i am truely amazed that         i have heard or read of no one suggesting this possibility         with all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and         the adults wearing gas masks it had to have been chaotic inside         i can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or         accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over  with the winds it         would have quickly gotten out of control     so we are left with two reasonable possibilities  that the fire was an fbi  accident and that the fire was started by the bd  i find the latter more  likely based on the evidence ive seen so far     no i think that d is also quite reasonable  i personally cant really asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue i would probably take an accident either fbi or bd over intential setting of the fire     i would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds  the coroner was on the today show this morning and categorically denied that theyve reach any such conclusions  he pointed out that under intense heat sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports ive read and heard     in short theres been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on monday  we should remain skeptical until more information is

of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon  the idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring fullblown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century  the need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years  as soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one human beings wanted to reach them     tracing the history of the many imaginative and often prescient attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology science astronomy and engineering  once space travel became feasible there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board or off the ground for that matter  these also are described in theis book for the same reason as the prespaceage and preflight ideas are  they are all accurate reflections of their particular eras dreams abilities and knowledge  virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500 as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel is listed chronologically  the chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures  they also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries  they reveal connections influences and evolutions hitherto unsuspected  every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration  nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing  this allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss to visualize differences similarities and influences  this text will be of interest to students of astronautical history and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams   science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating  the unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship  special features  includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft both real and fictional  contains scores of illustrations artwork drawings and photos contemporary with the subject  this includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels exclusive photos and drawings fromsoviet spacecraft rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films and

jon livesey writes    noting that a particular society in this case the mainland uk  has few religously motivated murders and few murders of any  kind says very little about whether interreligion murders elsewhere  are religiously motivated    no but it allows one to conclude that there is nothing inherent  in all religion or for that matter in catholicism and protestantism  that motivates one to kill  motivates or allows    the christian bible says that one may kill under certain circumstances   in fact it instructs one to kill under certain circumstances       id say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them to kill under certain circumstances  i do get your distinction between motivate and allow and i do agree that if a flavour of theism allows atoricities then thats an indictment of that theism  but it rather depends on what the certain circumstances are  when you talk about christianity or islam then at least your claims can be understood its when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls apart  one could believe in a god which instructs one to be utterly harmless   for my part i conclude that something  else is required  i also happen to believe that that something  else will work no less well without religion  any easy themus will  do  and what does religion supply if not an easy themus  not necessarily  love thy neighbour does not supply a themus  it demolishes it  and my definition of religion is broader than my definition of theism as i have explained   by insisting that even the murder of four labourers chosen because  they were catholics and who had nothing to do with the ira by   protestant extremists is not religously motivated i think what   you are saying is that you simply will not accept any murder as   being religiously motivated    no  what about that guy who cut off someones head because he believed   he was the devil incarnate  that was religously motivated  what about the protestant extremists who killed four catholic  labourers     that wasnt religiously motivated  not in my opinion  if they were doing it because of some obscure point of theology then yes  but since all protestants dont do this nor do they elect extremists to do it for them its just too broad too say religion did this  im saying that the causes are far more complex than that  take away the religious element and youd still have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism  you know when most catholics and protestants worldwide say stop the  killing one might listen to that especially when you claim not to read minds    also the murders ensuing from the fatwa on mr rushdie the inquisitions  and the many religous wars  whats so special about these exceptions    isnt this all just a grabbag of adhoc excuses for not considering some other murders to be religiously motivated    whats the general principle behind all this  the general principle is that its fairly clear to me at least that religion is the primary motivator enabler whatever of these  its not nearly so obvious whats going on when one looks at ni apart from violence of course   its not an abstract argument   northern irish protestants say  we dont want to be absorbed into am officially catholic country    now what are we supposed to do   are we supposed to reply no  thats only what you think you dont want   mr odwyer assures us  that no matter what you say you want you really want something   else    you think the unionists wouldnt mind being absorbed into a noncatholic   country other than the uk of course   its a terrible thing to lose  a mind   maybe the word country is there for more than just kicks  i certainly dont believe that the unionists are in it for god  i think  they wish to maintain their position of privilege  im still listening to what they say and you are still telling us  your version of what they think   you read minds and i dont  youve speculated on my motives often enough and you dont take my statements of my own beliefs at face value  therefore your claim  not to read minds has no credibility with me sorry   i also note that  you fail to answer my question  it just looks to me very much like you have an axe to grind  especially as you are indeed ignoring what  most protestants say  which is stop the killing  the people you refer to are properly described as unionists not protestants  as for their position of privilege what is that if not religion based  it is based on politics bigotry and heartless extremism  none of these things are synonymous with

light the atomic model is a mathematical representation of physical phenomena  a model that can and probably will continue to change over time  that makes it  subjective the model that is  however the model gives us an objective way to talk about the physical world  to put it another way the quantum mechanical model of the atom allows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable and unambiguous results which is objective  however as bohr and einstein duked it out midcentury the interpretation of those reapeatable observable measurements is quite subjective bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion was inherent in the nature of the universe  einstein said particle motion was deterministic but it was our measurement shortcomings that introduced the

dan schaertel writes  in article 21627ousrvroulufi kempmpphoenixoulufi petri pihko writes  dan schaertel dpsnasakodakcom wrote      i love god just as much as she loves me if she wants to seduce me  shell know what to do       but if heshe did you would probably consider it rape    probably because it is rape      simple logic arguments are folly  if you read the bible you will see   that jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic   our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  yet some think it is   the ultimate  if you rely simply on your reason then you will never   know more than you do now     your argument is of the type youll know once you try  yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried and believed  for many years but were eventually honest enough to admit that   they had lived in a virtual reality      obviously there are many christians who have tried and do believe so    so nothing  it may work for some but not for others it doesnt give any insight into an overall god or overall truth of a religion it would seem to be dependent solely on the individual as well as individuallycreated  and since christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better than ours i do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary or even particularly attractive      to learn you must accept that which you dont know    what does this mean to learn you must accept that you dont know   something righto but to learn you must accept something i dont  know why this is not the way i prefer to learn it is unwise to  merely swallow everything you read suppose i write a book telling  how the great invisible pink unicorn tm has helped me in my  daily problems would you accept this since you cant know whether  it is true or not      no one asks you to swallow everything in fact jesus warns against it   but let  me ask you a question  do you beleive what you learn in history class or for  that matter anything in school  i mean its just what other people have told  you and you dont want to swallow what others say right    well we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not but at the very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that say there was a military conflict in vietnam 25 years ago then there is a supernatural diety who wants us to live a certain way  the fact that jesus warned against it means nothing  i warn against it too  big deal     the life  death and resurection of christ is documented historical fact    this is not true  the first two choices here life and death are scantily documented and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the bible and that is totally circular  perhaps it be better to use the imagination or ones ignorance  someone else will address this im sure and refer you to plenty of documentation  as much  as anything else you learn  how do you choose what to believe and what not to  i could argue that george washington is a myth  he never

nothing more disgusting than christian attempts to manipulateinterpret the old testament as being filled with signs for the coming of christ  every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is autmoatically interpreted as the cross  what a miscarriage of philology     there is no way to get into a sceptical heart  you can not say you have given a   sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have  you must trust not just go   to church and participate in its activities  were you ever willing to die for what  you believed    well since we have skeptical hearts thank goodness there is no way to get into us  here we have the irreconcilable difference christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub trustbelieffaith without knowledge  if i am lucky one day and i happen to be thinking of god at the same time my enkephalins go up then i may associate this as a sign of god it will feel right and i will trust without knowing  maybe  religosity does not seem to be anything that is conclusively arrived at but rather it seems to be more of a sudden affliction i believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed many of us were not  the question is is suchg an

941,941,from brianlplarizonaedu brian ceccarelli 6026219615 subject re is it good that jesus died organization lunar  planetary laboratory tucson az lines 120  brian ceccarelli wrote thats me   kent i am not accusing you of evil things  jesus is accusing you  and it is not only you that he is accusing  he is accusing everyone  me you and everyone in the world is guilty  whether one  sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with   whether we do evil things  we do them regardless    kent sandvik responds   hmm it seems that this is the core of christianity then you   have to feel guilty      i think i see where you are coming from kent  jesus doesnt view guilt like our modern venacular colors it     feelings have nothing to do with guilt  feelings arise from the state of  being guilty  feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive  feelings are a  reaction from guilt  jesus is talking about the guilt state not the  reaction   let me give you an example  have you ever made a mistake  have you ever lied to someone  even a little white lie   have you ever claimed to know something that you really  didnt know  have you ever hated someone  have you ever been selfish are you guilty of any one of these   the answer is of course yes  you are guilty  period  that is it what jesus is getting at  no big surprise   feelings do not even enter the picture   consider jesuss use of the word guilt as how a court uses it  jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being imperfect  the bible calls it the state that we are all sinners  we all do bad things  even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our  guilt that we are all sinners     it is it in our nature to do bad things  we are sinners therefore we do bad things  being a sinner is fact  it is not a pleasant fact  but it is just a fact  we are not perfect   calling us sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a human being  guilty as charged   and then theres this single personality that will save you from this  universal guilt feeling  you can handle your guilt in one of two ways  acknowledge you made a mistake learn from it and try to not do it againin the meantime not punishing yourself for it  which is the way jesus wants you to handle or it  this is the healthy way  or two the destructive way  put yourself down slap yourself and feel like crap never forgive yourself force yourself to say a thousand hail marys    even to suicide  this the way  jesus does not want us to deal with it   all people fall into this  category to some extent in their lives  jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt feeling  jesus is in the business of showing us how much he loves us despite our guilt  jesus knows we are guilty  that isnt new to him  it is no big deal to him he just wants you to realize  that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him that is what he wants you to know  why because he wants to  have your company  you are immensely valuable to him jesus wants a relationship with you however in our present sinful nature we are incapable of having this relationship    god is perfect  we are not  you cannot fit a square peg into a round hole  however god has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him god has provided jesus so that whosoever just believes in jesus will have their nature changed  the holy spirit will move it  and now divine nature is now within lives our very beingand us and god communicate with each through his unifying holy spirit  the benefits of this are endless  for with the divine nature living within us we can now see our imperfections better  we can now head them off at the pass  with the power of the holy spirit living in us we now have his power to help us overcome our shortcomings   because the divine nature lives  within us we can now understand profound bible passages that never before we could understand  because the divine nature now lives within us we now  have authority over demonic forces  and lastly because the divine  nature now lives within us we have eternal lifefor the holy spirit is eternal  the relationship with jesus is of the utmost importance  because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom it is your relationship to the living god remember what jesus said at the tail end of matthew when he separated the goats from the sheep   many people in the last day will ask him didnt i prophesy in your name and do miracles and do good things in your name   and what did jesus say depart from me for i never knew you  that is the cornerstone of  christianity kent  jesus must know you as his friend  it is your  relationship to jesus  if he is your friend and you are his you will be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven     brian i will tell you a secret i dont feel guilty at all  i do mistakes and i regret them however ive never had this  huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder  good  it shows that you have a strong selfimagethat you love yourself  that is the second greatest commandment jesus taught  if only more people could do as you do   as i said before  in the common english venacular feeling guilty has a different meaning than the state of guilt   this all is a very clear indication that you need a certain  personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain  religious doctrines and if your personality type is   opposite then you are not that easily attached to a certain  world view system  i believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego a lot less selfcenteredness and a lot more unconditional love   there are humans that subscribe to the same notion the nice  thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden  the shoulders feel far more relaxed  yes  you have stated what jesus said  remember  come to me take my yoke upon your shoulders for my burden is light  a yoke is used to direct oxen to do work  once you have a relationship with  jesus you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life  having  god at your side is of great advantage

are you drawing for what you call orthodox  who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant  whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to look at the bible in order to see the truth but what of those who see biblical things differently from you  are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it  rick i think we can safely say 1 robert is not the only person who understands the bible and 2 the leadership of the lds church historicly never has  lets consider some personal interpretations and see how much trust we should put in orthodox mormonism which could never be confused with orthodox christianity          in one of his attacks on christians the mormon apostle bruce r mcconkie said they thrash around indarkness in trying to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised messiah he also said christians are wrong to believe that jehovah is the supreme deity god the father and that christ came into mortality as his only begotten son mcconkie then stated what mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter he said that elohim is the father and jehovah is the son    being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists   have gone in defining their threeinone god it comes as no surprise   to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to   identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the   promised messiah some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the   supreme deity whose son came into mortality as the only begotten as   with their concept that god is a spirit this misinformation about the   gods of heaven is untrue the fact is and it too is attested by holy   writ that elohim is the father and that jehovah is the son who was   born into mortality as the lord jesus christ the promised messiah   promised messiah p 100          notice that mcconkie said the christians are as wrong about their threeinone god and their belief that god is a spirit as they are in their understanding of who elohim and jehovah are before examining mcconkies attack and its validity we shall read a few more statements by mcconkie and other mormon sources concerning the words elohim and jehovah mcconkie stated    the chief designation of christ that has been preserved for us in   the old testament as that ancient work is now published is the   exalted nametitle jehovah promised messiah p 367    elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted   nametitle of god the eternal father a usage that connotes his   supremacy and omnipotence he being god above all gods mormon   doctrine p 224          agreeing with mcconkie on the question of who elohim and jehovah are the apostle james e talmage stated    elohim as understood and used in the restored church of jesus   christ is the nametitle of god the eternal father whose firstborn   son in the spirit is jehovah  the only begotten in the flesh   jesus christ jesus the christ p 38          a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve apostles of the mormon church states that god the eternal fatheris designated by the exalted nametitle elohim articles of faith p 466 christ in his preexistent antemortal or unembodied statewas known as jehovah articles of faith p 471          today mormon leaders teach that elohim in the ot refers to god the father and jehovah refers to christ mcconkie attacked christians for saying jehovah can refer to the father he stressed that these two nametitles should not be changed around so that christ is called elohim and the father is called jehovah the fatheris elohim not jehovah jehovah is christ and christ is jehovah they are one and the same person promised messiah p 111          in the ot of the kjv of the bible the hebrew word elohim is used to refer to the true god false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel when referring to the true god elohim is translated with a capital g when referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel it is translated with a small g it is translated four times as judges exod 216 2289 once as judge 1 sam 225 twice as mighty gen 236 exod 928 once as angels ps 85 once as godly mal 215 once as great gen 308 and once as very great 1 sam 1415          the word jehovah is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel points taken from the word adonai  many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was yahweh or yahveh however since jehovah rather than yahweh is the word used by mormonism this section will also use jehovah instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of mormon leaders regarding that name jehovah unlike elohim is never used of false gods it is the personal name of the triune god of the bible in the kjv jehovah is rendered primarily lord sometimes god and rarely lord          now that we understand something about the words elohim and jehovah and their use by mormon leaders we shall consider the apostle mcconkies attack on christians for believing the father is jehovah in trying to prove that jehovah refers exclusively to christ mcconkie cited several verses from the bible some of these verses and mcconkies interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right remember mcconkie said the father is not jehovah he is only elohim the first example we shall consider involves mcconkies interpretation of ps 1101 of this verse he stated    of whom spake david when his tongue was touched by the holy spirit   and he testified the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right   hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool ps 1101 two   lords are here involved one is speaking to the other one is greater   than the other one is making provision for the triumph and glory of   the other who are they and what message is contained in this   messianic prophecy   what think ye of christ our lord asked certain of his detractors   toward the end of his mortal ministry whose son is he is christ   the son of god or of someone else is he to be born of a divine parent   or will he be as other men  a mortal son of a mortal father that he   was to be a descendant of david was a matter of great pride to all the   jews and so they answered the son of david   davids son truly he was but he was more much more and so our   lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture   asked how then doth david in spirit call him lord saying the lord   said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine   enemies thy footstool if david then call him lord how is he his   son that is if he is only the son of david how is it that the   great king acting under inspiration calls him lord and worships him   as such and we might add who is the other lord the one who spake   unto davids lord can there be any question as to how jesus is   interpreting the words of the psalm he is saying that it means the   father said unto the son elohim said unto jehovah sit thou on my   right hand until after your mortal ministry then i will raise you up   to eternal glory and exaltation with me where you will continue to   sit on my right hand forever promised messiah pp 101102   emphasis added          agreeing with the above statement by mcconkie the following remark in the mormon pamphlet what the mormons think of christ p 6 reads the lord elohim the father said unto my lord jehovah the son brackets in original          mcconkie clearly stated that it is elohim the father who is speaking to jehovah the son in this psalm however when one looks at the hebrew word translated lord it becomes apparent that either the first lord is not the father or else the father is jehovah either way mcconkie is wrong the psalm reads    the lord jehovah said unto my lord adon sit thou at my right   hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool ps 1101          the first lord in this verse is jehovah who mormonism says is christ not the father the second lord is the hebrew word adon singular for adonai meaning master or lord if the first lord is the father and the second lord is the son then the father is jehovah and the son is adon however if the father is not jehovah as mcconkie claimed then the first lord is jehovah the son but who then is adon obviously the father is jehovah in this psalm and his son is adon          another example involves isa 426 about which mcconkie stated the following    i the lord have called thee in righteousness isaiah quoted the   father as saying of christ and will hold thine hand and will keep   thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the   gentiles isa 426 promised messiah p 81 emphasis added          mcconkie said the father was speaking of christ in this passage which reads    i the lord jehovah have called thee in righteousness and will hold   thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the   people for a light of the gentiles isa 426          according to mcconkie i the lord refers to the father and thine and thee refer to christ however the lord who is speaking is jehovah which means either mcconkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the father is jehovah          another example involves ps 2278 of these verses mcconkie stated    the same psalm says all they that see me laugh me to scorn they   shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord   that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in   him ps 2278 the fulfillment as jesus hung on the cross is   found in these words the chief priests mocking him with the scribes   and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be   the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will   believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will   have him for he said i am the son of god the thieves also which   were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth matt   274144 promised messiah pp 530531 emphasis added          ps 2278 reads as follows    all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they   shake the head saying he trusted on the lord jehovah that he would   deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him          mcconkie said these verses had their fulfillment as jesus hung on the cross that means the person who was scorned in these verses was christ who then was the lord in whom he trusted it was jehovah the father          another example involves ps 3113 and ps 419 regarding them mcconkie stated the following    with reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our   lords arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was they took counsel   together against me they devised to take away my life ps 3113   as to the role of judas in those conspiracies the psalmist says   mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my   bread hath lifted up his heel against me ps 419 promised   messiah p 532          apostle mcconkie said these psalms refer to christs arrest and judicial trials we shall first consider ps 31 and then ps 41 while mcconkie only quoted verse 13 of ps 31 verse 14 will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter    for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while   they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my   life but i trusted in thee o lord jehovah i said thou art my god   elohim ps 311314          mcconkie said verse 13 referred to jesus christ verse 14 goes on to tell that he christ trusted in the lord who is called his god or elohim mormonism teaches that the god above jesus is elohim the father verse 14 however reveals that the elohim of the man jesus is jehovah the father          in ps 41 mcconkie only quoted one verse however two verses will be considered in this examination    yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my   bread hath lifted up his heel against me   but thou o lord jehovah be merciful unto me and raise me up that   i may requite them ps 41910          mcconkie stated above that verse 9 referred to judas role in christs death since it was judas who was the familiar friend who lifted up his heel the pronouns mine i my and me in verse 9 must refer to christ notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there is a change of pronoun to thou which refers to the lord jehovah then the pronouns me and i which refer to christ are used again that means christ was speaking to jehovah the father in these verses          another example involves mcconkies following remark about ps         1104    one of the great messianic prophecies spoken by the mouth of david   says the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for   ever after the order of melchizedek ps 1104 promised messiah   p 450          mcconkie admitted this is a messianic prophecy involving christ the question is what in this verse refers to christ    the lord jehovah hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest   for ever after the order of melchizedek ps 1104          does the lord which is jehovah refer to christ if mcconkie is right and jesus is jehovah but the father is not then the lord would have to refer to christ but who then is the one addressed as the priest forever after the order of melchizedek the bible reveals that the one referred to is jesus christ heb 5810 620 7 therefore the lord jehovah in ps 1104 is the father          another example involves isa 53412 of these verses mcconkie stated    of the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah isaiah said      the lord has laid on him the iniquities of us all      it pleased the lord to bruise him promised messiah p 234      emphasis added          mcconkie rightly said these verses refer to the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah however what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the father is jehovah verse 6 reads all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord jehovah hath laid on him christ the iniquity of us all and verse 10 reads yet it pleased the lord jehovah to bruise him christ          obviously the lord who laid on christ the iniquity of us all and who bruised him is god the father who is called jehovah in these verses          remember mcconkie stated that some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity and that christ came into mortality as his only begotten son he called this concept misinformation that is untrue to prove that it is mcconkie who is misinformed and believing untruth two scriptural references 2 sam 714 ps 27 will be examined mcconkie stated the following regarding these scriptures    in the midst of a passage that is clearly messianic the lord says of   the seed of david i will be his father and he shall be my son 2   sam 714 in the second psalm the whole of which is also clearly   messianic occurs this statement thou art my son this day have i   begotten thee ps 27 paul quotes both of these statements in   hebrews 15 and says they are prophecies that christ would come as the   son of god promised messiah p 143          mcconkie cited heb 15 to show that 2 sam 714 and ps 27 refer to christ who would come as the son of god since mcconkie first referenced 2 sam 714 this examination will too however along with verse 14 verses 1113 will also be included    and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people   israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the   lord jehovah telleth thee that he will make thee an house   and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers   i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy   bowels and i will establish his kingdom   he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of   his kingdom for ever i will be his father and he shall be my son 2   sam 71114          these verses teach that the lord jehovah would have a son the messiah         in the second example mcconkie cited ps 27 this examination will include verse 8 notice that it is the lord jehovah who says thou art my son this day have i begotten thee    i will declare the decree the lord jehovah hath said unto me thou   art my son this day have i begotten thee   ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance   and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession          mcconkie said these verses of scripture are clearly messianic and he acknowledged they teach that christ would come as the son of god what he is not willing to acknowledge however is that these scriptures also teach that the father is jehovah and that the sectarians who believe jehovah is the supreme deity whose son is jesus christ the only begotten are right in their belief          another example involves mic 54 of this verse mcconkie stated the following    and so truly did our lord act during his mortal ministry truly   this is he of whom it is written he shall stand and feed in the   strength of the lord in the majesty of the name of the lord his   god for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth mic   54 promised messiah p 182 emphasis added          according to mcconkie the pronoun he at the beginning of mic 54 refers to christ during his mortal ministry who then is the lord his god mic 54 reads    and he christ shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord   jehovah in the majesty of the name of the lord jehovah his god   elohim for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth          obviously the lord of jesus christ is jehovah the father who is referred to as jehovah his elohim          another example involves ps 22 and isa 611 of these verses mcconkie stated the following    a number of messianic passages speak of the lord andhis   anointed ps 22 signifying that the chosen one was consecrated   and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his jesus   applied these passages to himself by quoting isaiahs prophecy the   lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek isa   611 and then saying this day is this scripture fulfilled in your   ears luke 421 promised messiah pp 182183 emphasis added          the first source mcconkie quoted  ps 22  reads as follows    the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel   together against the lord jehovah and against his anointed          mcconkie said the anointed one was christ if that is true who was jehovah if jehovah is always christ who was the anointed one obviously jehovah is referring to god the father and the anointed is indeed referring to christ the second source mcconkie cited is isa 611 which states    the spirit of the lord adonai god jehovah is upon me because the   lord jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek   he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to   the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound          the one who was anointed to preach bind up proclaim and open was jesus christ who then was the one who anointed him this verse says the lord jehovah did the anointing again we face the same problem if jehovah does not refer to the father but only to christ then jesus anointed someone but who as mcconkie pointed out jesus applied these passages to himself therefore the jehovah who anointed christ is god the father          other examples could be cited to show that mcconkie and other mormon leaders are wrong when they say god the father is not jehovah however these should be enough to expose their error          now what about mormonisms claim that jesus is jehovah but he is not elohim it is true that jesus is jehovah the following scriptures prove this fact    thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer   the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first and i am the last and   beside me there is no god isa 446   jesus said i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and   was dead rev 11718    saith the lord jehovahthey shall look upon me whom they have   pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only   son zech 12110   behold he christ cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him   and they also which pierced him rev 17    i am the lord jehovah thy god the holy one of israel isa   433   ye denied the holy one christ and the just acts 314    and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of   the lord jehovah shall be delivered joel 232   the name of jesus christ of nazareththere is none other name   under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts 41012    behold the lord god jehovah will come with strong handhis   reward

christ with all his saints 1   thess 313    the lord jehovah is my shepherd ps 231   jesus said i am the good shepherd john 1014    saith the lord god jehovah i will seek that which was lost   ezek 341516   the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost   luke 1910    for i am the lord jehovah thy god the holy one of israel thy   saviour isa 433   looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great   god and our saviour jesus christ tit 213 see also jer 425 and   rev 15 mal 36 and heb 138 1 kin 82839 and john 22425   isa 258 and 2 tim 110 ps 1072429 and matt 826 prov312 and   rev 319          while mormons are right when they say jesus is jehovah they are wrong when they say he is not elohim the bible reveals that jehovah is the only true elohim there is all others are false remember jehovah is the personal name of the triune god who has revealed himself in the bible          before we consider biblical quotes which show that jehovah and elohim are not two separate gods as mormons claims let us first note that not only are both god the father and christ addressed as jehovah and elohim but so is the holy spirit    whereof the holy ghostsaidthis is the covenant that i   will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my   laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and   their sins and iniquities will i remember no more heb 101517   emphasis on holy ghost and said added   behold the days come saith the lord jehovah that i will make a   new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah   i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts   and will be their god elohim and they shall be my people i will   forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more jer   31313334 emphasis added    for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy   men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost 2 pet 121   emphasis on holy ghost added   the spirit of the lord jehovah spake by me and his word was in   my tongue 2 sam 232 see also heb 3711 with ps 95611          let us now continue with the biblical quotes which show that jehovah and elohim are not two separate gods as mormons claim    and when the lord jehovah saw that he moses turned aside to see   god elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said   moses moses and he said here am i bruce r mcconkie   acknowledged that it was christs voice that spoke to moses in the   burning bush promised messiah p 394   and the lord jehovah said   and moses said unto god elohim behold when i come unto the   children of israel and shall say unto them the god elohim of your   fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his   name what shall i say unto them   and god elohim said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus   shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto   you   and god elohim said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto   the children of israel the lord jehovah god elohim of your   fathers the god elohim of abraham the god elohim of isaac and   the god elohim of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for   ever and this is my memorial unto all generations exod   3471315    and god elohim spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord   jehovah exod 62    i am the lord jehovah and there is none else there is no god   elohim beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me   isa 455    but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim he is the living god   elohim and an everlasting king jer 1010    thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer   the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first and i am the last and   beside me there is no god elohim isa 446    therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus   saith the lord jehovah whose name is the god elohim of hosts   amos 527    behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lords   jehovahs thy god elohim the earth also with all that therein   is deut 1014    wherefore thou art great o lord jehovah god elohim for there is   none like thee neither is there any god elohim beside thee   according to all that we have heard with our ears 2 sam 722    and he said unto them i am an hebrew and i fear the lord jehovah   the god elohim of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land   jon 19    for who is god elohim save the lord jehovah or who is a rock   save our god elohim ps 1831    blessed is the nation whose god elohim is the lord jehovah   ps 3312 see also ps 14415    hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god   elohim the lord jehovah the creator of the ends of the earth   fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his   understanding isa 4028    the mighty god elohim even the lord jehovah hath spoken and   called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down   thereof ps 501    sing unto god elohim sing praises to his name estol him that   rideth upon the heavens by his name jah and rejoice before him ps   684 regarding the word jah bruce r mcconkie stated jah   hebrew yah is a contracted form of jehovah jahveh or yahweh  all   of which names have reference to christ the god of israel mormon   doctrine p 391    and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from   baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god elohim whose   name is called by the name of the lord jehovah of hosts that   dwelleth between the cherubims 2 sam 62    the great the mighty god elohim the lord jehovah of hosts is   his name jer 3218    o my god elohim make them like a wheel as the stubble before the   wind   fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o lord   jehovah   that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art the most   high over all the earth ps 83131618          the bible clearly teaches that jehovah is elohim in fact he is the only elohim there is he is the true the living the mighty the great and the everlasting elohim he is the elohim of israel of all the kingdoms of the earth and of the heavens he is the creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon jehovahs name is elohim of hosts amos 527          not only is jehovah elohim but elohim is jehovah the bible reveals that elohims name is jah ps 684 jehovah ps 8318 and jehovah of hosts 2 sam 62 jer 3218   the nation whose elohim is jehovah is blessed ps 3312 clearly this is not the jehovah and elohim of the mormons          another mormon error regarding elohim and jehovah is the belief that elohim not jehovah is the father of all the spirits including jesus in the articles of faith by apostle james e talmage a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve apostles states that god the eternal fatherelohim is the literal parent ofthe spirits of the human race p 466 this doctrinal exposition also states explicitly that jesus christ is not the father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth for he is one of them he is the son as they are sons and daughters of elohim p 473          the apostle talmage stated that elohimis the nametitle of god the eternal father whose firstborn son in the spirit is jehovah jesus the christ p 38          the apostle bruce r mcconkie stated the following about this matter jehovahchristdid in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof but when it came to placing man on earth there was a change in creators that is the father himself became personally involved all things were created by the son using the power delegated by the father except man in the spirit and again in the flesh man was created by the father there was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned promised messiah p 62 emphasis added          mormon leaders claim that jehovahchrist did not create either mans spirit or his body they maintain that the mormon elohim who is the father created man both in spirit and body the bible reveals the truth about who created man    and moses spake unto the lord jehovah saying   let the lord jehovah the god elohim of the spirits of all   flesh set a man over the congregation num 271516 see also   162023 emphasis added    the lord jehovah which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth   the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within   him zech 121 emphasis added    the lord jehovahmade us this soul jer 3816    for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for   the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have   made   saith the lord jehovah isa 571619 emphasis on soulsi   have made added    behold i am the lord jehovah the god elohim of all flesh   jer 3227 emphasis added    thus saith the lord jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee   from the womb   i am the lord jehovah that maketh all things isa 4424   emphasis added    thus saith the lord jehovah   i have made the earth and created man upon it isa 451112   emphasis added    god elohim created man upon the earth   unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord   jehovah he is god elohim there is none else beside him deut   43235    thus saith god el the lord jehovahhe that spread forth the   earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the   people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein isa 425    thus saith the lord jehovah of hosts the god elohim of   israel i have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon   the ground jer 2745 most emphasis added          the bible reveals that it is jehovah who is the elohim of the spirits of all flesh and of all flesh itself that it was he who formed the spirit of man within him that he made us this soul and formed us from the womb he did indeed create man          if mormon leaders are right when they say jesus is jehovah then they are wrong when they say he did not create man if they are right when they say the father is the one who created man then they are wrong when they say he is not jehovah          although mormon leaders teach that jesus did not create man mormon scriptures teach that he did the bom states the following    behold i am jesus christ i am the father and the son   and never have i showed myself unto man whom i have created for   never has man believed in me as thou hast   behold this body which ye now behold is the body of my spirit and   man have i created after the body of my spirit eth 31416   emphasis added    for it is i that taketh upon me the sins of the world for it is i   that hath created them mos 2623 emphasis added    the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of   jacobis that same god who created the heavens and the earth and   all things that in them are   behold he created adam mor 91112 emphasis added          dc 9310 states that the worlds were made by him christ men were made by him all things were made by him and through him and of him emphasis added          another error by bruce r mcconkie involving jehovah and his creation is the belief that jehovah had many premortal spirits helping him create included in this alleged group was joseph smith jr    that he christ was aided in the creation of this earth by many of   the noble and great spirit children of the father is evident from   abrahams writings unto those superior spirits christ said we will   go down for there is space there and we will take of these   materials and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell abra   32224 michael or adam was one of these enoch noah abraham   moses peter james and john joseph smith and many other noble and   great ones played a part in the great creative enterprise doctrines   of salvation vol 1 pp 7475 mormon doctrine p 169          the bible reveals the truth about this matter    thus saith the lord jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee   from the womb i am the lord jehovah that maketh all things that   stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by   myself isa 4424    which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of   the sea job 98          jehovah by himself created all things he had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting him          regarding the mormon elohim the apostle mcconkie stated elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted nametitle of god the eternal father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being god above all gods mormon doctrine p 224 he also stated that jesusis above all save the father only promised messiah p 363          the bible states that the one who is god above all socalled gods is the triune god jehovah    for the lord jehovah is a great god el and a great king above   all gods elohim ps 953    for thou lord jehovah art high above all the earth thou art   exalted far above all gods elohim ps 979    now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all gods   elohim exod 1811 see also ps 1355 deut 1017          if mormon leaders are right when they say jehovah is god the son and elohim is god the father these verses from the bible would be teaching that the mormon son is above his father however as mcconkie clearly stated mormons believe elohim the father not jehovah the son is the god above all gods  that jesus is above all except the father yet the bible teaches that jehovah is above all elohim          at a byu dev on march 2 1982 bruce r mcconkie made the following remark about praying to jesus    another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly   to christ because of some special friendship they feel has been   developed   this is plain sectarian nonsense our prayers are addressed to the   father and to him only   perfect prayer is addressed to the father in the name of the son   it is uttered by the power of the holy ghost our relationship with   the lord pp 1920          mcconkie states on p 335 of his book promised messiah that the mormons pray to the father not the son on p 306 of the same book mcconkie states that christ the son is jehovah this is important to remember because although mcconkie said prayer is not to be offered to the mormon christ who is jehovah the bible states repeatedly in the ot that people prayed to jehovah and he not only heard those prayers but he accepted them as valid requests the following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to jehovah    in my distress i called upon the lord jehovah and cried unto my   god elohim he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came   before him even into his ears ps 186    and the lord jehovah said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy   supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this   house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine   eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually 1 kin 93    and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our   supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the lord   jehovah thy god elohim even for all this remnant jer 422    o lord jehovah i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to   the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who   desire to fear thy name neh 111    and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this   prayer and supplication unto the lord jehovah he arose from before   the altar of the lord jehovah from kneeling on his knees with his   hands spread up to heaven 1 kin 854    he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed   unto the lord jehovah 2 kin 433    go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord jehovah the god   elohim of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy   tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years isa 385    i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid i   said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord jehovah and   thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin   for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when   thou mayest be found ps 3256          notice above in ps 326 that the godly pray to jehovah according to mcconkie and other mormon leaders that is christ the very one to whom mcconkie said people should not pray          the bible reveals there is only one true elohim and his name is jehovah all other elohim are false they are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true elohim and idolatry    for the lord jehovah is great and greatly to be praised he is to   be feared above all gods elohim   for all the gods elohim of the nations are idols but the lord   jehovah made the heavens ps 9645    thou shalt have no other gods elohim before me exod 203    now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all gods   elohim exod 1811    and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god   elohim and walk after other gods elohim and serve them and   worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely   perish deut 819    thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods elohim   they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me   for if thou serve their gods elohim it will surely be a snare unto   thee exod 2332 33    take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn   aside and serve other gods elohim and worship them deut 1116    that ye come not among these nations these that remain among you   neither make mention of the name of their gods elohim nor cause to   swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them   josh 237    neither walk after other gods elohim to your hurt jer 76    but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim he is the living god   elohim jer 1010    and they forsook the lord jehovah god elohim of their fathers   which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods   elohim of the gods elohim of the people that were round about   them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the lord jehovah   to anger jud 212    shall a man make gods elohim unto himself and they are no gods   elohim therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i   will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know   that my name is the lord jehovah  jer 162021    and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord jehovah choose you   this day whom ye will serve whether the gods elohim which your   fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods   elohim of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my   house we will serve the lord jehovah   and the people answered and said god elohim forbid that we should   forsake the lord jehovah to serve other gods elohim josh   241516          these verses teach that the only true living elohim in heaven and on earth is jehovah  the triune god who made heaven and earth and all therein          jehovah is greater than any elohim because all other elohim are idols the reality behind them is demonic deut 3217 jehovah elohim has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false elohim he told his people not to have any elohim but him he told the people that if they left him for the false elohim those elohim would be a snare to them and they would be hurt and would perish he warned the people to take heed that their heart be not deceived into worshiping serving swearing by and making covenants with false elohim jehovah elohim told his people he would eventually judge all false elohim and their followers          despite these warnings and guidelines elohims covenant people forsook him and believed in and worshiped the false elohims of the people they came in contact with ju 106 states that the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord jehovah and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods elohim of syria and the gods elohim of zidon and the gods elohim of moab and the gods elohim of the children of ammon and the gods elohim of the philistines and forsook the lord jehovah and served not him          this examination has shown that the elohim of mormonism like the elohim in ju 106 is not the true jehovah elohim therefore the people who leave the true elohim for the mormon elohim will do evilin the sight of the lord jehovah          although mcconkie attacked christians for their belief in a triune god who is spirit and for their belief that god the father jehovah sent his son into the world these beliefs are true god is triune he is spirit he is jehovah and he did send his son into the world to redeem mankind          it is obvious from this examination that it is not the christians who thrash around indarkness about who elohim and jehovah are one wonders what holy writ mcconkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that elohim is the father and that jehovah is the son he certainly did not mean the bible which teaches that the father son and holy spirit are all the one jehovah elohim he apparently did not mean the dc either because chapter 109 verses 14910 1419222429344247566877 refer to the father as jehovah  summary          obviously joseph fielding smiths statement that the mormons have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of god doctrines of salvation 1279 is not accurate the mormon gods are not the true god as mormonism claims but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against god and idolatry          in answer to jesus question but whom say ye that i am mormons say jesus is someone different from the jesus who is revealed in the bible and whom the apostles preached therefore anyone trusting in the mormon jesus is believing in another jesus whom paul warned about          bernard p brockbank of the first quorum of the seventy admitted in the may 1977 issue of the ensign a mormon publication that the mormon jesus is different from the christian jesus he stated that it is true that many of the christian churches worship a different jesus christ than is worshipped by the mormons or the church of jesus christ of latterday saints p 26          the people who believe in the mormon jesus are committing adultery against god and idolatry they do not have the son therefore they do not have the father and they do not have eternal life as the apostle bruce r mcconkie rightly stated salvation comes only by worshiping the true god promised messiah p 163 mcconkie also rightly stated that the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living god because the true names of deity can be applied to false concepts of god mormon doctrine p 270 remember that the apostle stephen l richards admitted that joseph smith jr gave a new conception of god and the godhead contributions of joseph smith p 1          it is important for the people who have left the true triune god revealed in the bible to repent and return to him they must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in mormonism the bible says    all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from   me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the lord   jehovah the fountain of living waters jer 1713    and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god   elohim and walk after other gods elohim and serve them and   worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely   perish deut 819    thou shalt make no covenant withtheir gods elohim exod 2332    put away the strange gods elohim that are among you and be   clean and change your garments gen 352    flee from idolatry 1 cor 1014          it is necessary that christians heed the warnings of the bible if they do they will not fall into the sins of adultery against god and idolatry remember to know the only true god is eternal life john 173    their gods elohim shall be a snare unto you ju 23 see also   exod 233233    ,3

procedures with govt money then lets get the  government to pay for counselling that provides abortion alternatives   lets get the government to pay for adoption fees  lets get the government  to pay for all the things that make abortion necessary  why not  they  are certainly legal procedures  counselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as biased as counselling that only provides abortion information  how about providing counselling that will give a woman help in finding what she is comfortable with  your adoptionfunding idea may be a good one  any idea if it is feasable   the only way hell is involved is that it is going to be a good skiing resort  before i give in to paying for abortions  i believe it is wrong and i  wont pay for it without a gripe  im not for making them unlawful id  rather spend money on saving lives than a bunch of investigations and court  hearings and all this other crap we are spending our time on   you know whos really cleaning up on all this abortion stuff  lawyers  i  say lets pass laws to make adoption cheaper easier and infinitely more  supportive of the birth mother  lets eradicate the stigma reduce the  cost pay the price for life  making adoption easier on the birthmother may help reduce abortion but it will not eliminate the need for it  abortion is not done just because the mother cant care for the child and doesnt feel good about giving it to strangers  abortion is done because the mother can not afford the pregnancy  soapbox off   a person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights of another person    cool enough  youll have more trouble defining the terms in that statement  than getting people to agree to it  for example i perceive i have a right  not to participate in what i feel is murder  i dont think the government  should either  on the other hand since we are having trouble proving that  it is murder there is no right to stop someone from doing it if they so  choose either by legal means or harassment  of course persuasion is  allowed but watch that line between persuasive and harassing  the second part is a definition of a person  a simplistic explanation is that a person is a member of society  most normal adult human beings are good examples of people  most children over two years old are people as well  the simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation with them  it is actually more complicated than that but i have no desire to spend the time it would take to explain it to you  read the thread why is bodily autonomy so important for more explanation and justification  but why is your definition authoritative enough for the whoe us  surely you can understand there are other definitions with equal right of  consideration  then please justify why being human automatically makes something valuable and why that includes the unborn   if the government refused to fun abortions due to the qualms of a minority of the population then it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of babies whose mothers wanted an abortion but could not afford one and now that baby will also require care for 18 years  true  that needs to be fixed  it is part of the problem  if clinton has a  medical program to get underway let him address this too  it is cheaper  in the long run to save lives later they will be productive members of  society  at least if his plan works  no they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society  even if they do that is many years in the futureuntil which they are a burden on someone or society  there is also the matter of the mother  forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent her from being a productive member of society  actually i was refering to the minority that objects to abortion not those who object to federal funding  i admit i did not say it very clearly and apologize for that   to refuse to fund abortions  is to remove that choice from some women and add the additional burden to society for no reason  no  this is really flawed logic  it would be like me saying i was born  with a disfigured face and i want cosmetic repair  it is  discriminatory that i cannot make that choice and so you must pay for it    that a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or  otherwise that someone else should foot the bill sic for that choice  ok look  its like this  we are footing the bill  maybe they will take choice a  maybe they will take choice b  maybe they will take choice c  they cant afford any one of them  if they take choice a wed have to pay them say 5  if they take choice b it would cost us 20  if they take choice c it will cost us 20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next 18 years  which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay for  now some people happen not to like choice a  other people happen not to like choice c paying for it that is  c has been around and paid for for years  even though it means we spend a lot of money we cant in conscience refuse to pay for it  now a has been around and is perfectly legal but it hasnt been funded in the past  now a is going to be funded but some people object  they dont like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice a  so we could refuse to fund a at all  then those women who cant afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice b or c which will cost all of us more money  most of us dont see any reason at all why more money should be spent to the effect of removing personal choice from some women  the alternative is to fund a if that is what the mother chooses  we will also still fund b and even c if that is what the mother chooses  however some women will certainly choose a and that will then save us 15 we otherwise would have had to spend  your taxes are not being raised to fund a choice you object they are being lowered because we will fund a choice that is legal despite your objections to it  actually your taxes are not really going to go down as im sure you would point out  but the amount that is saved in that area can help out in anotherlike our massive debt   if you disagree then give us some reasons  given that abortion is legal and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the population  it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford them who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you would force upon them  i refuse to pay more taxes to remove choice from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure  what  i say objection to the procedure is irrelevant  uncle bill doesnt pay for  breast augmentation facelifts etc  why abortions  its elective  surgery    those other procedures you mention only cost money  there is no savings in other procedures that would be required down the road without them in fact there could be additional costs down the road because of them this is quite different from the case of abortion  as for your argument you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making  it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too so you  are just as guilty of removing a choice by withholding funds  think about  it  a poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded whats she  gonna do  what choice have your plans given her  your kind of double talk really makes me ill  this is bullshit  we are not refusing to make the alternative affordable too  if we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth then your statement would make sense  but that is not the case so it doesnt if clinton tried to block funding for prenatal care and delivery or left it out of his healthcare plan i would certainly object  i would also be quite surprised   prochoice  ha  proabortion really fits in your case  yes but probably not your definition of it or for the reasons you think  if youre gonna fund one choice you have to fund them all at the very  least  you stupid fuck  we do want to fund all the choices  you are the one who wants to not fund all the choices          imho if we fund the adoption choice right meaning not just  throwing money at it but cutting costs esp legal costs we wont need  abortion anymore  your humble opinion is still wrong  even with easy adoption there is still the fact that pregnancy takes several months  months in which a young woman could need to be getting an education  like finishing high school entering college finishing college getting a jobthings that are much harder to do if you have to take a break for a few monthsthings that have a massive impact on her future productivity   have a right to life  a fetus is not a person  you can not have a conversation with them    ah  lets kill the mentally incompetant as well  or how about people we  just dont like since we cant have a conversation with them  you can have a conversation with the mentally incompetant  and even though you personally may refuse to have a conversation with people you just dont like it is still possible for others to have a conversation with them  it is not possible for anyone to have a conversation with a fetus  they are not biologically independent    nor was my son at the age of 6 weeks  he was breastfed and would not take a bottle  just what does biologically independent mean  ill be happy to  punch any definition full of loopholes  he was still biologically independent  at least to the same extent you are now  he consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner  he breathed his own air  a fetus on the other hand gets its nutrients already digested by the mother  it gets its oxygen from the mother as well  that is not biologically independent  their awareness is questionable    aha you admit it is questionable  yet you are willing to kill it even if  it may be very aware  i suggest you rethink your viewpoint  awareness is only part of what makes a member of society  it is the minimal conceivable requirement yet many people seem to think that something without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing of a true member of society  i keep asking but i still havent seen a real justification for why the life of a nonsentient creature should be worth the suffering of a sentient being  i havent read every response on the threads ive been asking on yet so well see if i see one later  they have no experiences in the real world to make up a personality  this is also true of quite a few unix programmers  so what  d  anyone who can program in unix has a lot of experiences in the real world  rob ,3

kaxcsnottacuk wrote  about my reply   diplomatic   it a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming usenet diplomacy is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through isnt it   i realize im fighting occams razor in this argument so ill try to  explain why i feel a mind is necessary   kevin unfortunately you are now delving into field i know too little about algorithms your reasoning as i see it is very much along the lines of roger penrose who claimed that mathematical insight cannot be algorithmic in his book the emperors new mind concerning computers minds and the laws of physics however penroses claim that he has mathematical insight or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look could be just illusions  we are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints  i try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective realising that it might not be anything special but certainly useful thinking back of what i wrote do you think worms have minds or not they are able to experience pain at least they behave  just like that yet it is conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a total synthesis of c elegans from the elements would such a worm have a mind   firstly im not impressed with the ability of algorithms theyre  great at solving problems once the method has been worked out but not  at working out the method itself  this is true to some extent however i do not think that our brains work like computers at all in fact there is substantial evidence skarda 1985 skarda  freeman 1987 that brains work more or less chaotically generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators i suppose   the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered does  this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already  preprogrammed into our brains this is somewhat unlikely given that  our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic  material much of which isnt used  indeed this is extremely unlikely given the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain i suggest however that before trying to understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms   kevin take a look at the references i mentioned and think again i still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind are neurologists neuropsychologists and biologists but do not  flame me for my opinions since they study beings that are conscious   the reason i am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different  and please do not bring qm into this discussion at all  not all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness plays some special role in physics i would say it doesnt   the other problem with algorithms is their instability not many  algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet  people survive strokes without going completely haywire there are  sideeffects but patients still seem remarkably stable also  neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate   can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt various bits of its  code  again brains are not computers dont forget this this does not mean they need something else to work  they just work differently their primary purpose is perception and guidance of action  selfawareness and high intelligence are later appearances   the next problem is the sticky question of what is colour replace  colour with the sensation of your choice presumably the  materialist viewpoint is that its the product of some kind of  chemical reaction the usual products of such a reaction are energy   different chemicals is colour a mixture of these  you are still expecting that we could find the idea of green in our brains somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical this is not how i see it the sensation green is a certain timedependent pattern in the area v4 of our visual cortex and it is distributed with the help of areas v1 and v2 to the rest of the brain   indeed a firing pattern i have sometimes thought of our consciousness as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns but this is just idle speculation  scientific americans september 1992 issue was a special issue on mind and brain have you already read it from cover to cover  there are two articles on visual perception so you might be  interested  but again please note that subjective experiences cannot be  observed from a thirdperson perspective if we see nothing but  neuronal activity we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the mind  kalat 1988 writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the  patients state of mind for instance a patient whose septal area was stimulated without his knowledge by remote control during a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression and started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend  stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing situations when the patients have started flirting with the therapist  in conclusion there is evidence that  1 brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences     brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage  2 conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in    various areas of brain  when we think of colours our    visual cortex is activated etc  3 consciousness is an afterthought  we become conscious of our    actions with a half a second delay and our brains are ahead    of our conscious will by at least 350 ms   thus i think it is fruitful to turn the question why do i see colours around and ask what is this i that seems to be  observing since it seems that our conscious mind is not the king of our brains   if this is so a  computer wont see colour because the chemistry is different does an  algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an  equivalent that doesnt it shouldnt because the outputs of each  algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances so why do  we see colour  this depends on what is meant by seeing colours does a neural network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 see the numbers if it is capable of sorting them  if you are asking why does an animal who is conscious of itself as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who doesnt i have a good answer  read my previous posting where i wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap roles and act more morally so that they dont unconsciously kill each other with newly discovered weapons a bit extreme but this is the basic idea  when early homo became more and more efficient in using tools  a sense of identity and the concept of self had to evolve in line with this development indeed respect for others and  conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages for social animals such as early humans    if i remember correctly quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction  with two processes acting on it the first process has been called  unitary evolution or u is governed by schroedingers equation  and is well known the second process called various things such as  collapse of the wavefunction or state vector reduction or r  and is more mysterious it is usually said to occur when a  measurement takes place although nobody seems to know precisely  when that occurs when it does occur the effect of r is to abruptly  change the wavefunction  if minds are required for this does this mean that until human minds came to the scene wavefunctions never collapsed but remained in the superpositions for aeons my how powerful we are  this has been discussed before and i think this topic is irrelevant since we do not agree that minds are necessary and neither do physicists    anyway im speculating that minds would be in part x there seems to  be some link between consciousness and r in that we never see linear  superpositions of anything although there are alternative  explainations for this ive no idea how a brain is supposed to access  part x but since this is only speculation that wont matter too  much  my main point is that there might be a place for minds in  physics  i agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above  physics needs sharp minds to solve many real problems    ill go back to my nice padded cell now if thats ok with you   its ok if you dont forget to take with you the

irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism  deletion  theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it  imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered  bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor  thats your claim now back it up  i consider your argument as useful as the following  belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism  therefore belief is a factor in fanaticism  true and utterly useless  note this is any belief not belief in gods    tiring to say the least i have backed it up read the first statement  i have read it  conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point    the latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy saying someone believes something is hardly an information about the person at all saying someone is a theist holds much more information further the correlation between theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism because of the special features of theistic belief  truth by blatant assertion  evidence     gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators  and the really dangerous people  the sources of fanaticism  are often none of these things  they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing  thats a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say  if you believe that youre incredibly naive    you frank odwyer are living in a dream world i wonder if there is any base of discussion left after such a statement as a matter of fact i think you are ignorant of human nature even when one starts with something one does not believe one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says   to give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement  the onus of proof is on you sunshine  what makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say  especially when they say one thing and do another or say one thing closely followed by its opposite  the practice is not restricted to theism but its there for anyone to see  its almost an epidemic in this country  just for instance if it is harder for a camel to pass thru the eye of a needle why is the catholic church such a wealthy landowner  why are there churches to the square inch in my country   now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you  to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument  and it reads to me like a warmup for censorship and restriction of religious freedom  ever read animal farm  thats a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism  no some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some fanaticism    your last statement simply isnt implied by what you say before because youre trying to sneak in innate features of all theism  the word youre groping for is some    bogus again not all theism as is is fanatic however the rest already gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and theism and further the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them to switch to fanatism easily it takes just a nifty improvement in the theology  truth by blatant assertion       gullibility by the way is one of them  no shit sherlock  so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make    because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people causing the correlation and the whole discussion started that way by the statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism which you challenged  indeed i did  as i recall i asked for evidence  what is the correlation of which you speak       and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer  i said it reads like a warm up to that  thats because its an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice themus split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls    blah blah blah i am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights protects me better from fanatics than the other way round  of course other people are always fanatics never oneself  your wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me   it is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between that argument and the rise of fanatism so far it is just another of your assertions  so  you can do it     2  define irrational belief  eg is it rational to believe that      reason is always useful   irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information  well there is a glaring paradox here  an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational  which is it  thats bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed  ok its oval  its still begging the question however  and though that certainly is allowed its not rational  and you claiming to be rational and all    another of your assertions no proof no evidence just claims  hey  i learned it from you did i do good     at the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didnt hear a refutation before so were back   deal with it  you cant use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful  someone who thinks reason is crap wont buy it you see    that is unusually weak even for you the latter implies that my proof depends on their opinion somehow who does not accept that there are triangles wont accept pythagoras wow thats an incredible insight i dont have to prove them wrong in their opinion it is possible to show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims unreliable or even absurd statements to be information  totally circular and totally useless   their wish to believe makes them believe things are judges by their appeal and not by their information it makes you feel good when you believe that may be good for them but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls from belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt  truth by blatant assertion  ive seen as many bogus proofs of the  nonexistence of gods as i have of their existence    rational systems by the way does not mean that every data has to come from logical analysis the point is that the evaluation of the data does not contradict logic it easily follows that such a system does not allows to evaluate if its rational in itself yes it is possible to evaluate that it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that system but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon that has as little impact as the possibility of a demon ala descartes  this just doesnt parse sorry   so far it just a matter of consistency i use ratiional arguments to show that my system is consistent or that theirs isnt the evaluation of the  nor this predictions does not need rationality it does not contradict however     your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular  anybody else think godel was silly    stream of consciousness typing what is that supposed to mean     the first part of the second statement contains no information because you dont say what the beliefs are  if the beliefs are strong theism andor strong atheism then your statement is not in general true  the second part of your sentence is patently false  counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it   ive been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here  an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way  further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms  what is it you are trying to say  that at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable for no particular reason at all  example i am not dreaming    nope there is evidence for it the trick is that the choice of an axiomatic basis of a system is difficult because the possibilities are interwoven one therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway  id like to see this alleged evidence   one does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method for usefulness the foundation is laid by how one feels at all thats not how one feels about it  i see  you have no irrational beliefs  but then fanatics never do do they    compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational  i cant agree with this until you are specific  which theism  to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have   using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals andor the way the world works  imo any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational  that does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of intelligence  some atheists are also scientists for example    they dont use theism when doing science or it wouldnt be science please note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well they just prohibit formulating them as objective statements  ergo nothing is objective  fair enough     the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis  i dont understand this  can you formalise your argument  person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste  of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekitesidolatersprotestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects  peculiar definition of interesting but sure  now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak   why arent my catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example   maybe they dont believe in it  maybe its the conjunction of b asserts b and jailkill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant  it certainly seems so to me but then i have no axe to grind here    the example with your neighbours is a fallacy that your neighbours dont says little about others and there were times when exactly that happened  nope its not a fallacy   it just doesnt go to the correlation you wish to see   and tell me when it is not irrelevant why are such statements about amalekites and idolaters in the holy books please note that one could edit them out when they are not relevant anymore because gods dont err what does that say about that message  excuse me  the holy books   and how come we had theists saying genocides ordered by god are ok a god is the easiest way to excuse anything and therefore highly attracting to fanatics not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatics can have on the rest of the believers happens again and again and again  a god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything nor the only way     frank

of            astrophysics are bristling with integrals partial            differentials and other fancy mathematics  in this book by            contrast mathematics is conspicuous by its absence except            for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text             larson emphasizes concepts and declares that mathematical            agreement with a theory does not guarantee its conceptual            validity                            dewey b larson was a retired engineer with a bachelor            of science degree in engineering science from oregon state            university  he developed the theory described in his books            while trying to find a way to mathematically calculate the            properties of chemical compounds based only on the elements            they contain                            the universe of motion describes the astrophysical            portions of larsons consistent integrated comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe a kind of            grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists and            astrophysicists claim to be looking for  it is built on two            postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of            space and time                            1 the physical universe is composed entirely of one            component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete            units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time                            2 the physical universe conforms to the relations of            ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are            absolute and its geometry is euclidean                            from these two postulates larson was able to build a            complete theoretical universe from photons and subatomic            particles to the giant elliptical galaxies by combining the            concept of inward and outward scalar motions with            translational vibrational rotational and rotational           vibrational motions  at each step in the development he was            able to match parts of his theoretical universe with            corresponding parts in the real physical universe including            even things not yet discovered  for example in his 1959            book he first predicted the existence of exploding galaxies            several years before astronomers started finding them  they            are a necessary consequence of his comprehensive theory  and            when quasars were discovered he had a related explanation            ready for those also                            as a result of his theory which he called the            reciprocal system larson totally rejected many of the            sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists            including black holes neutron stars degenerate matter            quantum wave mechanics as applied to atomic structure            nuclear physics general relativity relativistic mass            increases relativistic doppler shifts nuclear fusion in            stars and the big bang all of which he considered to be            nothing more than mathematical fantasies  he was very            critical of the ad hoc assumptions uncertainty principles            solutions in principle no other way declarations etc            used to maintain them                            the universe of motion is divided into 31 chapters             it begins with a description of how galaxies are built from            the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters            which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that            accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in            from the antimatter half of the physical universe  galaxy            formation from the mythical big bang is a big mystery to            orthodox astronomers  he then goes on to describe life            cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and            solar systems result from type i supernova explosions of            single stars                            several chapters are devoted to quasars which according            to larson are denselypacked clusters of stars that have            been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies            and are actually traveling faster than the speed of light            although most of that speed is away from us in time                            astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against            observations that contradict their theories would find            larsons explanations quite valuable if considered with an            open mind  for example they used to believe that gamma ray            bursts originated from pulsars which exist primarily in the            plane or central bulge of our galaxy  but the new gamma ray            telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from            all directions uniformly and do not correspond with any            visible objects except for a few cases of directional            coincidence  larsons explanation is that the gamma ray            bursts originate from supernova explosions in the antimatter            half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic            sector  because the antimatter universe exists in a            reciprocal relation to our material universe with the speed            of light as the boundary between them and has three            dimensions of time and only one dimension of space the            bursts can pop into our material universe anywhere seemingly            at random                            larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from            books journal articles and leading physicists and            astronomers  in this book 351 of them are superscripted            with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the            end of the book  for example a quote from the book            astronomy the cosmic journey by william k hartmann            says our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if            we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars            form unfortunately we cannot  larsons book contains            logical consistent explanations of such mysteries that are            worthy of serious consideration by all physicists            astronomers and astrophysicists                   for more information answers to your questions etc            please consult my cited

91993apr212341591206ualredu lines 125  in article 1993apr212341591206ualredu  nunnallyacshardingedu john nunnally writes  when are we going to hear a christian answer to this question   in paraphrase   on what or whose authority do christians proclaim that they  are above the law and above the prophets 7 major and 12 minor and not   accountable to the ten commandments of which jesus clearly spoke his opinion   in matthew 51419 what is the source of this pseudodoctrine who is  the pseudoteacher who is the great deceiver ok heres at least one christians answer jesus was a jew not a christian  in this context matthew 51419 makes sense  matt 517 do not think that i jesus came to abolish the law or the prophets i did not come to abolish but to fulfill  jesus lived under the jewish law  however he was the culmination of the promises of the prophets  he came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey gods purposes verse 18 says for truly i say to you until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law until all is accomplished  the key to this verse imho is the last  phrase  jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the  law was supposed to accomplish    jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the law and unless im mistaken heaven and earth have not yet passed away am i mistaken and even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word of jesus do you really think that all is accomplished  verse 19  whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments and so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven  taken in the context of jesus teaching jewish  people about living lives under the law this makes sense  then why didnt jesus say any jew who annuls  in v 19 are you saying that all of jesus recorded words mean nothing to gentiles are you really saying that jesus only spoke for and to the jews jesus didnt mention your name does that mean he wasnt speaking to you when you read the words of jesus do you think he is speaking to someone other than you  in general it appears that jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about doing away with the law  that was not  jesus intent at all  you said above that jesus was the fulfillment of the law are you saying that does not mean doing away with the law  he had come to earth to live the law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by god to his  people all the way back to eve gen 315the serpent will bruise your  heel but he will bruise his head  gen315jps i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers they shall strike at your head and you shall strike at their heel  gen315nrsv i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers he will strike your head and you will strike his heel  gen315kjv and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel  looks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the word  jesus appeared to be doing away with the law  because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the law of god  he regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only  gods law in the matthew passage jesus is defending his dedication to the law  and defending himself against his accusors  almost the entire sermon  on the mount matt 57 is dedicated to helping the jewish people  understand the true intent of the law sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the pharasees and their traditions  only helping the jewish people  in galatians 32326 paul describes the relationship of jesus to the  law in this way 23 but before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed  24 therefore  the law has become our tutor to lead us to christ that we may be  justified by faith  25  but now that faith has come we are no  longer under a tutor  26 for you are all sons of god through faith  in christ jesus i believe this says that after christ was revealed the law had  served its purpose ie our tutor to lead us to christ and now we are no longer under a tutor  the law has been fulfilled  as christ said he would do  you are using your interpretation of paul as an argument against the clear words of jesus  god the author of the old law and the christman jesus are the same personality  therefore the old law and the new testament the last will and testament of jesus are based on the same moral principles  it makes sense that many of the principles in the old law are reexpressed in christianity   reexpressed care to define that a bit better  on the other hand now that the law has fulfilled its purpose and   what are heaven and earth gone away where did they go is all accomplished for example revelations explain please  christians relate to god through christ not the law it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the mysteries of this new relationship  ie baptism  representing christs death burial and resurrection rom 638 the lords supper as a memorial to his sacrifice i cor 1126 and sunday as a day of worship commemorating his resurrection matt 281ff acts 207  again your interpretation of paul versus the clear word of jesus do you see any problems here when did heaven and earth go away when was all accomplished  ok thats one christians explanation  i dont claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and i welcome other christians to offer other alternatives please excuse the long posting  thanks for your interest if you have read  this far ,3

1068,1068,from pgfsrl03cacsusledu phil g fraering subject re over zealous shuttle critics organization univ of southwestern louisiana lines 139  khayashhscuscedu ken hayashida writes  rockwell international in downey california in conjunction with the other shuttle contractors delivered the worlds most important and most revolutionary space vehicle  ha  one cannot argue with the fact that it flies lands and is reusable   watch me it flies it lands it gets rebuilt   in my opinion these were the only appropriate specifications for this program  thats not what they told us back in the 70s  it has been a test program from the start a logical follow to the x15 program and the later xseries lifting bodies  1 it isnt a logical followon a logical followon would have been either a russian snowfox type thingey for the lifting bodies or something like mmis space van or boeings tsto or the airbreathing tsto the military is allegedly using now that probably cost less to develop than the shuttle does to fly for a year  the engineering specs that the guys in the trenches had were to develop a system which was manratable could land reliably and could be reflown  these goals were quite visionary for the 1970s and i would argue that they are challenging even today including for the dcx program  keep that attitude and itll be a couple centuries before we get real access to space unless another country without all that baggage comes along and kicks our ass in the space race  i do not recall a 1 flightweek specification in the final nasa specs for the space shuttle program  if you have such documents i would find them most revealing and interesting  as far as i can tell the only people touting a  1 flight per week flight rate were people on capitol hill or selling books  to the general public    or nasa hq that doesnt give the rest of the program plausible deniability if we deceide that it wasnt worth the money weve spent which is by now probably a lot more than apollo  imho political statements in the halls of the us congress are not admissable as engineering specs because specs should be determined by nasadod and contractors not by congressmen senators or presidents missions are defined by political leaders but not the engineering specs  yes but it gets sold on the basis of the political statements youre saying basically that it met the engineering specs which is questionable imho so its a success never mind that you couldnt get the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in a thousand years  the shuttle is the only reusable space vehicle  this automatically qualifies it as an unparalleled engineering success  you could argue about its political success  but engineering wise it is clearly the most advanced machine ever flown  i argue that engineering and technical data for hypersonic flight is valuable in and of itself shuttle should be justified or criticized on the basis of economics  you can get hypersonic flight data with an x15 or a followon x15 type vehicle for much less  and economics and engineering are interchangable engineering in the absense of economics is basically just physics and in terms of physics the shuttle looks like a failure next to the x15   then henry wrote  hssorry support that i can arrange for launchers all goes to launchers hsthat i have some hope of riding some day  at the moment thats hsdcxs hopedfor successors  i was disappointed by this and other similar statements from those vocal in  support of the dcx program   your support of dcx is based on hopes my support for the shuttle program is based on record   the shuttle program has a bad record i once had hopes for the shuttle program by now i know those hopes were false   all i have for dcx and similar and dissimilar experimental vehicles are hopes but at least i know they arent false hopes yet  i did support the shuttle way back when it didnt do nearly what it was supposed to its time to move on to something that might do the job of orbital delivery better or at all   i think that it is  also important to note that i do not object to dcx  it is visionary   i originally posted   i like the dcx idea  and i am really hopeful that itll be a stunning success   unfortunately dcxers are not willing to return that support the proven shuttle program  explain why you folks criticize shuttle when shuttle is exactly what you guys need in order to learn how to operate dcx onorbit  we dont want to learn how to operate on orbit it launches it shoves out the payload it lands it doesnt waste payload hauling up and down edo pallets and the like  the only thing to be learned from shuttle is how not to build a launcher  finally that bit about the proven shuttle are you hoping you can tell a lie enough times and get someone to believe it  i enjoyed your later postings regarding the comparisons between the shuttle and the soyuz project  although i may disagree with your method of analysis  you probably will disagree with mine 8  i think that the total impact of the shuttle program must be judged on the scientific and technical merit not on timelines and schedules do you agree   how much science and technology could have been done is the money spent on shuttle had been spent differently   as for now we need to stop thinking of dcx and shuttle as mutually exclusive  learn about economics and the current budget realities in the united states please  thanks for your time   phil fraering         number one good faith you convert pgfsrl02cacsusleduyou not tortured by demons  anon mahen missionary

frankd012s658uucp frank odwyer writes  in article 9304221138077q9rusnewsw165wmantiscouk mathew   mathewmantiscouk writes  got it in one  similarly a moral relativist will not judge one moral syste  to be better than another in every possible circumstance  this does not  however preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than anothe  in a specific set of circumstances  nor does it preclude a set of moral  relativists from collectively judging a moral system from some set of  circumstances which they all agree they are in    ok this makes sense to me  im serious youve explained something  to me which i never understood before  but just for grins suppose we  almost all agree that we are in a set of circumstances called reality  what then  then we all live happily ever after   seriously if we all agreed on the circumstances were in i suspect wed all agree on the best course of action  unfortunately i have no confidence that such a situation will ever arise   some of us think theres a big god in the sky some dont  some think theyve been chosen by god others disagree  some think they are infallible others think otherwise  until those disagreements over circumstances can be ironed out theres little hope of everyone agreeing       or say for all practical intents and purposes there is no frame  of reference in which thus and such is good isnt that approximately  objective in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to  outrun a snail  yes  i think that for example only a vanishingly small number of people would hold that theres a frame of reference in which gassing six million jews is good  so thats probably about as close to an objective moral value as ive encountered in my life so far                         for example if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area  isnt it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act even  though there conceivably might be some tailend case that would justify it  well i think your examples poor  if the bombs in iraq for example and was dropped by an american plane many people would hold that it was a moral act     and what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if    it isnt an objective reality for values      im sorry i cant parse an objective reality for values  could you tr  y   again      san objective reality for valuessome values are real even in the face   of disagreement    i still dont quite see what youre trying to say  i assume by values you  mean moral values yes  in which case what do you mean by real  what is  a real moral value as opposed to an unreal one    i mean to say that values are as real as horses whatever you understand  by a horse being real is pretty much what i mean about a value being real  hmm  so these moral values have a perceptible physical presence    if you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in   your opinion then all you get is infinite regress    sorry but in what way is it an infinite regress  it looks extremely finite  to me    i meant that its never more than your opinion  right and the chain ends right there  the buck stops with me  its not an infinite regress                                                         youve clarified this  for me above  my understanding is now that if a supermajority of relativists  agree that thus and such is wrong in almost any or all frames of reference  then theyre saying something which is to all practical intents and purposes  no different than what im saying  right  the key point however is that there are vanishingly few of these moral issues where we can get 999 of people to agree on the outcome for all frames of reference and agree on the frames of reference                                                       what you do not get   is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist   is inferior to that of the man of peace    sorry but thats not so  i can provide a justification for asserting that  the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace    i just cant provide a justification which works in all possible  circumstances    logically possible or actually possible  i cant manage either  killing hitler using a car bomb would have been a terrorist act but i have to admit that i couldnt exactly condemn it  although there are tricky philosophical issues to do with hindsight                                                by which i mean are you  stretching possible to include events such as the atoms in my terminal  switching places so that the terminal turns upside down or do you  think it likely that circumstances will arise in which terrorism is  superior to peace  i think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have been better

1205,1205,from bskendignetcomcom brian kendig subject re is it good that jesus died organization starfleet headquarters san francisco lines 143  jasonsatlastelecom jason smith writes bskendignetcomcom brian kendig writes    and i felt torn when i began to disagree with a lot of what the bible  and my priests told me   did it start getting a little uncomfortable  did your style start feeling a bit cramped  yes thats exactly what i felt  my heart just felt that what i was being taught was wrong  a basically good message but framed in errors  i could not with a clear conscience accept that women were somehow not equal to men that homosexuals are guilty of their lifestyle that pride in ones work is a bad thing that jesus died for me  i dont want anybody to die for me especially as an impersonal act where the person cant possibly even know me well enough to really know if im worth dying for or not  i was never able to accept the bit about jesuss death being a good thing  if that means that im just not comprehending a basic message of christianity then so be it  maybe im just not compatible with christianity  i just refuse to follow rules blindly and since i cant even convince myself that your god even exists in the way you describe it ive got to just follow my own conscience in these matters  i know how that goes  knowing i couldnt and didnt want to  live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me outside too    dont think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because i dont believe in your god  i will not steal and i will not murder  not because i fear divine repudiation but because these just arent in my character  you may think theres nothing keeping me from just running around on a murdering spree stealing things when im able insulting people for the heck of it because im not answerable to anyone but youd be wrong  im answerable to myself  a life like that would be a cheap life i happen to want to earn respect in myself  till i met the man that is  my initial break with christianity came after a lot of soulsearching and a lot of wondering why i could no longer feel the presence of god with me  i finally decided that i had once felt this presence just as i had felt my mighty teddy bear beside me when i was a little tyke protecting me from the monsters under the bed  that i had believed in god just as i had believed in the teddy bear as something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers  since then ive never abandoned the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity does exist  but there are a few times when in my darkened room by my bed i have set aside everything i believe for a moment and called out to whatevers out there because i want to know the truth even if it means abandoning everything i know  and i have not yet received an answer   only when i truly listened to myself body and soul did i realize  that i could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being  christian  there is a higher truth in the universe and christianity  just aint it  any suggestions on what or who or where it might be and why  nope  it may well be unknowable  scientists have suggested that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself the threedimensional universe may be mapped onto a fourdimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a twodimensional plane onto a threedimensional sphere see sphereland the sequel to flatland for more thoughts on this  our entire universe might just be an electron in a four dimensional universe which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that and so on and so forth until the variables become too much for us to even speculate on  that is theres no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to be so theres no reason at all to believe that your god exists nor had anything to do with it  ok you may say so now if im just being good am i doing good enough  thats for you to answer  if you feel youre doing fine then go ahead and ignore us foolish little christians  we can present what weve seen and experienced providing our witness but it isnt up to us to make that seed sprout    christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy book and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe guilt trips insinuations that im without morals arguments from disbelief how can you possibly believe that god doesnt exist and so forth  all im asking is for you to convince me  i want to be convinced but its not going to be easy  so much as you dont like what were selling there just may be someone out there that can identify with it  methinks you could give us all a  lesson in tolerance and back off  having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside i view it as harmful in many ways  it preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives and once its got these people it teaches them to have pity and sometimes starkly intolerant of others who do not share these views  maybe youll say that your religion doesnt teach that  but ive got to judge christianity from the christians i know  i feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in ones self and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that  so i hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people think  i want christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever and i want people who are considering christianity to realize that christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy fulfilled life  i have known some very nice christians who have done some very nice things  i think what sets these people apart from the general masses is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong and they know the weaknesses of their religion yet they still decide to believe but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think any less of people who dont agree with them  obviously the debate on the veracity and reliability of the source of the christians faith is far from conclusive notwithstanding how vehemently we propose otherwise  precisely my point  youve still not given me a reason to be a christian instead of a buddhist or a moslem   the nice thing about religion if you lose yourself deeply enough in  it is that eventually youll be able to feel justified in most  anything you want to do  yknow your right  fortunately for everyone around me im not religious   im a christian   just as the moslems arent religious and the buddhists arent religious  who is religious then      brian kendig                             je ne suis fait comme aucun   bskendignetcomcom

1206,1206,from einkaufaustinibmcom mark einkauf subject re need help zbuffering lines  areas together originator markeinkaufaustinibmcom organization ibm austin keywords zbuffer roundoff lines areas lines 105     david gorgen writes   im asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low  apparent precision in zbuffering that ive encountered in 2 different  pex implementations  i cant find any discussion of this problem in any  resources i can lay hands on eg the compwindowsxpex faq gaskinss  pexlibprogrammingmanual vendors documentation      the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching  artifacts resulting from the use of zbuffering with polylines that are  coplanar with filled areas  the interpolated z values along a line will  differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values  across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with  vertices of the area  because of this its a tossup whether the  zbuffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed  visually the result tends to be a dashedline effect even though the  line is supposed to be solid   using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly  different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one  for the areas and one for the lines  the pex structures or immediate  mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in  effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines  the  result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to  attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines   this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used  in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards ie  smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view  table entry used for areas  this means that when a point is transformed  to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than  if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias   i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount  to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the zbuffer  typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 ie 16 or 24 bit zbuffers  therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc  between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix  the stitching   but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0003  to 0006 of the range  empirically its worst when the npc z  component of the slope of the surface is high ie when it appears more  or less edgeon to the viewer  its as if only 8 or 9 bits of the  zbuffer have any dependable meaning  this amount is so great that one  problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through  areas which they are supposed to lie behind   ive observed the problem on both hewlettpackard and digital  workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree  the test  program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 5x implementation  this version is known to compile and run on an hpux system with pex  51   open questions      1 why does this happen            am i configuring the pex view table wrongly            is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines              as opposed to areas eg pixel centers versus corners which              could be corrected for            are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their              interpolators            something else      2 what to do about it            can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision              in zbuffered hlhsr            is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching              artifacts            am i just out of luck   we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstations  i was also shocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits assuming 24 bit z buffer  this seems huge but is only 1256 of the dynamic range  in those terms it doesnt seem so bad  what is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear due mainly to roundoff i believe  so the polygon is not planar in z but is more like a ruffles potato chip  ditto with lines  when you startend at different xy values the ridges are out of phase resulting in the stitch effect  you have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another but with different vertices  you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap   example   try polygon 1 100100100 100200100 200200100 200100100       polygon 2 125125100 125175100 175175100 175125100  your implementation is correct  in fact we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons  such as nurbs surfaces with isoparametric lines  without the trick the lines appear stitched as you say  when the application draws linespolygons independently the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting so the application must do it  this is what you have discovered and are doing bravo  note to ibmers  the information given here has been previously disclosed through proper channels so im not giving away any new unpublished info      mark einkauf      einkaufaustinibmcom    ibm  advanced workstations and systems  graphics systems

crew luk 2261  and the lord turned and looked upon peter and  peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice  joh 1338  jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake  verily  verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow still thou hast denied me thrice  joh 1827  peter then denied  again  and  immediately  the  cock crew  destruction of cities what said was jeremiah was zechariah  this is interesting because matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made  not the only time he does this either  mat 279  then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy  the prophet  saying  and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value  zechariah 111113 nothing in jeremiah remotely like  what was the color of the robe placed on jesus during his trial  scarlet  matthew 2728  purple john 192  the time of the crucifiction  mark says the third hour or 9 am but john says the sixth hour noon was when the sentence was passed  inscription on the cross  matthew    this is jesus the king of the jews mark9   the king of the jews luke9   this is the king of the jews john9   jesus of nazareth the king of the jews  what did they give him to drink  vinegar  matthew 2734  wine with myrrh  mark 1523  women at the cross  matthew said many stood far off including mary magdaline mary the mother of james and the mother of zebedees children  mark and luke speak of many far off and mark includes mary magdeline and mary the mother of james the less john says that jesuss mother stood at the cross along with her sister and mary magdalene  jesus last words   matt274650 and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice  saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yielded u the ghost  luke2346 and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father unto  thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost  john1930 when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is  finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost  events of the crucifiction  matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent that there was an earthquake and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that graves opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into jeruselem appearing to many beating jesus to the resurection mark and luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints  john is the only one who mentions jesuss side being peirced  burial of jesus  matthew says the jews asked pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being stolen by the disciples and for the tomb to be sealed all of this was supposedly done but the other gospels do not mention these precautions  how long was jesus in the tomb depends where you look matthew 1240 gives jesus prophesying that he will spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and mark 1034 has after three days meta treis emeras he will rise again as far as i can see from a quick look the prophecies have after three days but the postresurrection narratives have on the third day  time of the resurection  matthew says sunday at dawn mark says the sun was rising and john says it was dark   who was at the empty tomb  is it   mat 281  in the end of the sabbath as it began to  dawn  toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre  mar 161  and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the  mother  of  james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him  joh 201  the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene  early when  it  was  yet  dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre  whom did they see at the tomb  mat 282  and behold there was  a  great  earthquake  for  the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it mat 283  his countenance was like  lightning  and  his  raiment white as snow mat 284  and for fear of him the keepers did shake  and  became as dead men mat 285  and the angel answered and said unto  the  women  fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified  mar 165  and entering into the sepulchre they saw a  young  man sitting  on  the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted  luk 244  and it came  to  pass  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments  joh 2012  and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at  the head  and  the  other  at  the feet where the body of jesus had lain  belief that the disciples stole jesuss body  matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story but no other gospel makes this claim  appearences of the risen jesus  matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two marys and that jesus also told them to tell the disciples to meet him in galilee  the disciples then went to a mountain previously agreed opon and met jesus there  this was his only appearance except to the women at the tomb  matthew only devotes five verses to the visit with the disciples  mark says that jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country and that they told the rest of the disciples who refused to believe  later he appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime  luke says two followers went the same day that jesus rose from the dead to emmaus a village eight miles from jeruselem and there jesus jioned them but was unrecognised  while they ate a meal together that evening they finally recognised jesus whereopon he dissapeared  returning at once to jeruselem they told the disciples of their experience and suddenly jesus appeared among them frightening them as they thought he was a spirit  jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preached to them  john says jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose in jeruselem where they were hiding  he breathed the holy ghost opon them but thomas was not present and refused to believe eight days later jesus joined the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced thomas9once more jesus made an appearance to the disciples at the sea of tiberias but again was not recognised  after telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat jesus becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them  they all eat together and converse  the book of acts further adds to the confusion  it says that jesus showed himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection thus contradicting matthew mark luke and john and spoke to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of god and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight  and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing into heaven this same jesus which is taken from you into heaven shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven acts 1311  paul outdoes every other authority by saying that jesus was seen by 500 persons between the time of the resurection and the assension although he does not say where9he also claims that he himself as one born out of due time also saw jesus 1 cor 1568  the ascension  matthew says nothing about it9mark casually says that jesus was recieved into heaven after he was finished talking with the disciples in jeruselem  luke says jesus led the desciples to bethany and that while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven  john says nothing about it  acts contradicts all of the above  see previous section  when second coming  mat 2434  verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled  mar 1330  verily i say unto you that this generation shall  not pass till all these things be done  luk 2132  verily i say unto you this generation shall not  pass away till all be fulfilled  1 thessalonians 41518  how many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention  1 corinthians 155 12 matthew 2735 minus one from 12 acts 1926 mathias not elected until after resurrection mat 2816  then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them   ascend to heaven 9and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven 2 kings 211  9no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven 9 the son of man john 313  as you can see there are a number of contradictions in the account of the trial crucifiction and resurection of jesus  if these are good witnesses you would think that they could get some of these important details right  in fact i cannot find very many points on where they agree  you would think that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly observing because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth due to the nature of the story i doubt if it should be taken as any sort of truth                     alan  ,0

astrophysicists            claim to be looking for a unified field theory in which all            of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single            set of laws or equations  but they have been systematically            ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for 30 years                  the late physicist dewey b larsons comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe which he            calls the reciprocal system is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time                      1 the physical universe is composed entirely of one            component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete            units and in two reciprocal forms space and time                      2 the physical universe conforms to the relations of            ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are            absolute and its geometry is euclidean                      from these two postulates larson developed a complete            theoretical universe using various combinations of            translational vibrational rotational and vibrational           rotational motions the concepts of inward and outward            scalar motions and speeds in relation to the speed of light            which larson called unit velocity and the natural            datum                        at each step in the development larson was able to            match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the            real physical universe photons subatomic particles            incomplete atoms charges atoms molecules globular star            clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white            dwarf stars pulsars quasars etc even objects not yet

97213 and            should be available via interlibrary loan if your local            university or public library doesnt have each of them                  several of them including the last one are available            from the international society of unified science isus            1680 e atkin ave salt lake city utah  84106  this is the            organization that was started to promote larsons theory             they have other related publications including the quarterly            journal reciprocity                         physicist dewey b larsons background                     physicist dewey b larson was a retired engineer            chemical or electrical  he was about 91 years old when he            died in may 1989  he had a bachelor of science degree in            engineering science from oregon state university  he            developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute            chemical properties based only on the elements used                      larsons lack of a fancy phd degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is            not a valid reason  sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to clearly see the forest through the trees  at the same            time it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox            physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer            well enough to point out all their contradictions ad hoc            assumptions principles of impotence inconsistencies etc                       larson did not have the funds etc to experimentally            test his theory  and it was not necessary for him to do so             he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other            researchers experimental and observational data  and in            many cases his explanation fit better                      a selfconsistent theory is much more than the orthodox            physicists and astronomers have  they claim to be looking            for a unified field theory that works but have been            ignoring one for over 30 years now                      modern physics does not explain the physical universe            so well  some parts of some of larsons books are full of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree  and remember that epicycles crystal spheres            geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed            to explain it well but were later proved conceptually wrong                           prof frank h meyer professor emeritus of uwsuperior            wasis a strong proponent of larsons theory and was or            still is president of larsons organization the            international society of unified science and editor of            their quarterly journal reciprocity  he moved to            minneapolis after retiring                   super collider boondoggle                           i am against contruction of the superconducting super            collider in texas or anywhere else  it would be a gross            waste of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific            value                      most physicists dont realize it but according to the            comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist            dewey b larson as described in his books the strange goofy            particles mesons hyperons alleged quarks etc            which they are finding in existing colliders fermi lab            cern etc are really just atoms of antimatter which are            created by the highenergy colliding beams and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment                      a larger and more expensive collider will only create a            few more elements of antimatter that the physicists have not            seen there before and the physicists will be even more            confused than they are now                      are a few more types of antimatter atoms worth the 83            billion cost  dont we have much more important uses for            this wasted money                            another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground            cables  how much poisoning of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the supercollider                                 naming the super collider after ronald reagon as            proposed is totally absurd  if it is built it should be            named after a leading particle physicist                     larsonian antimatter                           in larsons comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe antimatter is not a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles  it has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light            which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum                       in larsons theory a positron is actually a particle of            matter not antimatter  when a positron and electron meet            the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their            respective photons of which they are made neutralize each            other                        in larsons theory the antimatter half of the physical            universe has three dimensions of time and only one dimension            of space and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our            material half                      larsonian relativity                           the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets venus earth jupiter            etc  the remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help prove einsteins general theory of relativity                      but the late physicist dewey b larson achieved results            closer to the 43 seconds than general relativity can by            instead using special relativity  in one or more of his            books he applied the lorentz transformation on the high            orbital speed of mercury                      larson totally rejected general relativity as another            mathematical fantasy  he also rejected most of special            relativity including the parts about mass increases near            the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on            doppler shifts those quasars with redshifts greater than            1000 really are moving faster than the speed of light            although most of that motion is away from us in time                       in larsons comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe there are three dimensions of time instead            of only one  but two of those dimensions can not be measured            from our material half of the physical universe  the one            dimension that we can measure is the clock time  at low            relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are            negligible but at high speeds they become significant and            the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor            larson often used the term coordinate time when writing            about this                            in regard to mass increases it has been proven in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light  but the formula for acceleration is            acceleration  force  mass a  fm  orthodox physicists            are ignoring the third factor force  in larsons theory            mass stays constant and force drops toward zero  force is            actually a motion or combinations of motions or relations            between motions including inward and outward scalar motions             the expansion of the universe for example is an outward            scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of            the socalled big bang which is yet another mathematical            fantasy                                                                 the universe of motion                 i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe            of motion by dewey b larson 1984 north pacific            publishers po box 13255 portland oregon  97213 456            pages indexed hardcover                      it contains the astrophysical portions of a general            unified theory of the physical universe developed by that            author an unrecognized genius more than thirty years ago                      it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical            mysteries including the formation of galaxies binary and            multiple star systems and solar systems the true origin of            the 3degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma           ray bursts and the true nature of quasars pulsars white            dwarfs exploding galaxies etc                      it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all            looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with            open minds                      the following is an example of his theorys success            in his first book in 1959 the structure of the physical            universe larson predicted the existence of exploding            galaxies several years before astronomers started finding            them  they are a necessary consequence of larsons            comprehensive theory  and when quasars were discovered he            had an immediate related explanation for them also                    gammaray bursts                 astrophysicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious gammaray bursts  they were            originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the            disc of our galaxy  but the new gamma ray telescope now in            earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly and their source locations in space do not            correspond to any known objects except for a few cases of            directional coincidence                      gammaray bursts are a necessary consequence of the            general unified theory of the physical universe developed by            the late physicist dewey b larson  according to page 386 of            his book the universe of motion published in 1984 the            gammaray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the            antimatter half of the physical universe which larson calls            the cosmic sector  because of the relationship between the            antimatter and material halves of the physical universe and            the way they are connected together the gammaray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at            random  this is why the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects and come from all            directions uniformly                      i wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gammaray burst to kill all or most            life on earth  there would be no way to predict one nor to            stop it                      perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were            actually caused by nearby gammaray bursts                   larsonian binary star formation                           about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double  but orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them                      but binary star systems are actually a likely            consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of            the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey            b larson                      i will try to summarize larsons explanation which is            detailed in chapter 7 of his book the universe of motion            and in some of his other books                      first of all according to larson stars do not generate            energy by fusion  a small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse  the rest results from the complete            annihilation of heavy elements heavier than iron  each            element has a destructive temperature limit  the heavier the            element is the lower is this limit  a stars internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements                      when the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of iron there is a type i            supernova explosion  this is because there is so much iron            present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process which larson explains in some            of his books better than i can                      when the star explodes the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light  the heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light because of the high temperature  the            explosion pushes that material over the speed of light and            it expands outward in time which is equivalent to inward in            space and it often actually disappears for a while                      over long periods of time both masses start to fall            back gravitationally  the material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a red giant star  the            material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a            white dwarf star  both stars then start moving back toward            the main sequence from opposite directions on the hr            diagram                      the chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space making a single lone star            again are near zero  they will instead form a binary            system orbiting each other                       according to larson a white dwarf star has an inverse            density gradient is densest at its surface because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed blown            outward in time   this eliminates the need to resort to            mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter neutron            stars black holes etc                   larsonian solar system formation                 if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively small then instead of a single            white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf            stars revolving around the red giant star but probably            still too far away in threedimensional time to be affected            by its heat etc  these will become planets                        in chapter 7 of the universe of motion larson used all            this information and other principles of his comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe to derive            his own version of bodes law                         black hole fantasy                 i heard that physicist stephen w hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black            holes merging together into a single black hole and            concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than            the sum of the two original black holes                      such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red            flag causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black            holes etc                      after reading physicist dewey b larsons books about            his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical            universe especially his book the universe of motion it is            clear to me that black holes are nothing more than            mathematical fantasies  the strange object at cygnus x1 is            just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black            hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to prove their theory                           by the way i do not understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist stephen hawking  the physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if hawkings severe physical            problem somehow makes him wiser  it does not                      i wish the same attention had been given to physicist            dewey b larson while he was still alive  widespread            publicity and attention should now be given to larsons            theory books and organization the international society of            unified science                                             electromagnetic propulsion                 i heard of that concept many years ago in connection            with ufos and unorthodox inventors but i never was able to            find out how or why they work or how they are constructed                      i found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112113 of the book basic properties of matter by            the late physicist dewey b larson which describes part of            larsons comprehensive general unified theory of the physical            universe  i quote one paragraph                      as indicated in the preceding chapter the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance             the electrons we find are derived from the environment  it            was brought out in volume i larsons book nothing but            motion that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities and that            although the motions that constitute these electrons are in            many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited  it follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector material half of the            universe most of which are uncharged  in this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space because they are inherently rotating units of space            and the relation of space to space is not motion  in open            space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system in the manner of a photon  in the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron            like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system  all            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation             meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later            whereby electrons are returned to the environment  the            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level                            note that in larsons theory uncharged electrons are            also massless and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning            around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate             unit velocity is the speed of light and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light            according to larsons theory  i might have the above and            below labels mixed up                      larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass           less uncharged electrons flying around at the speed of            light                      if this is true then the electromagnetic propulsion            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons or other particles in space perhaps giving them a            charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion in larsons theory an electrical charge            is a onedimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the            rotation of the particle                        the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in

      totally ignore larsons theory has they have                      larsons theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such            as gammaray bursts and the nature of quasars                      larsons theory deserves to be honestly and openly            discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals            in the us and elsewhere  and at least the basic principles            of larsons theory should be included in all related courses            at uwec uwmadison cambridge cornell university and

dss1443 goldstonecanberra 70 meter antennas respectively  initial results  indicate the delta dor pass on april 22 was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on april 23 was successfully performed  2  on april 23 a cruise science memory readout mro was performed for the magnetometer mag instrument  analysis indicates the data was received properly  3  on april 23 the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence  these relays were commanded closed by the cds command data subsystem prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at jupiter of the pps relayswiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge iesd  4  on april 26 cruise science memory readouts mro were performed for the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer euv dust detector dds and magnetometer mag instruments  preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly  5  during the period from april 26 to april 27 a navigation cycle was performed  this navigation cycle provided nearcontinuous acquisition of twoway doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over dss63 dss14 and dss43  6  on april 26 realtime commands were sent to test slew the radio relay antenna rra in preparation for the minisequence slew test on april 28 the rra was slewed from approximately 35 degrees from stow to approximately 203 degrees  preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18 degrees which was well within the predicted range  the rra was commanded back to approximately 152 degrees from stow  preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about 158 degrees also well within the predicted range  the rra motor temperature was at 1 degree c at the start of the activity and had increased to 16 degrees c at its completion       after verifying proper rra slewing the rra slew test minisequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on april 28  upon successful uplink a delayed action command dac was sent which will reposition the stator on may 4 to its initial pretest position  also a dac was sent to turn the twoway noncoherent twnc on april 28 prior to the start of the rra slew test minisequence  7  on april 27 a noop command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours its planned value during this mission phase  8  on april 28 the rra slew test executed nominally  the spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six rra slews starting at about 16 degrees from stow and going to 53 degrees back to 25 degrees then to 51 degrees back to 22 degrees then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees  all of the slews were well within the predicted range  the rra motor temperature was at 23 degrees c at the start of the activity and had increased to 44 degrees c at its completion  after completion of the rra slews realtime commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pretest configuration  9  the acdc bus imbalance measurements have

1267,1267,from dpwseicmuedu david wood subject re laws of god was re a kind and loving god inreplyto mleepostroyalroadscas message of sat 24 apr 1993 180951 gmt organization software engineering institute lines 155    mleepostroyalroadsca malcolmlee writes  dpwseicmuedu david wood writes    mleeraroyalroadsca malcolm lee writes  these laws written for the israelites gods chosen people whom god had  expressly set apart from the rest of the world  the israelites were a  direct witness to gods existence  to disobey god after knowing that god is  real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable  remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to   gods chosen people  but jesus has changed all of that  we are living in the  age of grace  sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  there is  repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ  and not just  for a few chosen people  salvation is available to everyone jew and gentile  alike    sorry if this is late for the thread but    i thought god was supposed to be constant and neverchanging  how do  you reconcile this common christian view with the paragraph above   god never changes    sorry but yes he does by your own description  he still loves us  sending jesus was one of his attempts to reconcile with mankind  humorous this notion of an allknowing allpowerful god who must attempt to reconcile with his lowly creations  i realize that it is not possible to penetrate such logic but is there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything and further that an attempt to reconcile implies a lack of omniscience  what you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god     also while were at it    1 how do you reconcile a kind and loving god with the  judeochristian view that sin was at one time immediately punishable  by death  was killing people for sinning gods way of showing  kindness and love   sinning in the face of god was punishable by immediate death  there are several ot passages to back this up  god is god    but all humans are sinners thus all prejesus humans should have been punished with death  we arent punished with sin now of course because god has changed  he required a brutal sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death    he cannot tolerate the prescence of sin in his midst    yet he does so now  he has changed  the sadistic murder of his own son has made him more tolerant of our sins  besides his midst is everywhere so your statement is meaningless he tolerates sin in hell which surely is in his midst as well  also given that he is allknowing he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sins as well as when and where so what does tolerance have to do with anything  all of this is absolute nonsense unless your god is not indeed allknowing and allpowerful or unless he doesnt take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you claim  and the israelites knew this  and still some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed  were these people kind and loving themselves    not relevant  the claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in reference to your god  the nature of his creationsvictims is not at issue  god gave them every break he could but in the end he really had no choice in the matter    i see an allknowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome would be and an allpowerful god who had no choice in the matter mindmush  seeing as how we were failing to achieve salvation on our own he sent his son to die for us  to be the ultimate sin offering    did i miss something  did you give some indication at to why a kind and loving god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his own botched creations to achieve salvation     2 is the fact the he no longer does this an admission on his part of  having made a mistake   he sent his son as a consolation to us out of love   i note that your answer physically follows my question but i fail to discern a connection between the two  by the way for what am i being consoled   3 now that we are living in the age of grace does this mean that  for our sins god now damns us to eternal hell after we die rather  than killing us immediately  if so is this eternal damnation an  example of a kind and loving god   hey lets be fair for a moment here  kind and loving does not mean a free ride   why not  by the way i note for the record that you didnt answer the questions   there is an amount of give and take as in any relationship parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that  children can do whatever they want  not  part of being a parent means administering punishment when the child is at fault    death andor eternal damnation is your idea of correctional punishment  i hope you arent a parent  part of being a parent means giving instruction  god tests us through the trial of life such that we may grow stronger  he teaches what is right and what is wrong    this is quite an elaborate fantasy that youve constructed but sadly it lacks a basis in reality  it also does not address the questions that i raised  the consequences of our actions are made clear to us be it heaven or be it hell  if god did not follow through with what he has warned us about he would not be a very good parent  the god that you describe is not a good parent but a tyrant  in parenting if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through with it the children will not take that parents words very seriously god does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and what not to do  by lifes trials we see the folly of doing our own will rather than his  he warns us about the consequences of rejecting him when it comes time for judgement    sorry was that the god of the bible whose rules i am to follow or the god of the koran  the vedas  the book of koresh  oh yes its all so clear  do we follow him  i will  bully for you ,3

1289,1289,from neesecerritosedu subject hell distribution world organization cerritos college norwalk ca lines 110      in the king james version of the bible there are three differents words  translated into the word hell  these greek words have totally different  meanings  the words are hades tartaros and gehenna      in bibical usage the greek word hades is used only 11 times in the  new testament and is roughly the equivalent to the old testament word sheol meaning the grave or pit compare acts 227 with psalms 1610  hades may be  likened to a hole in the ground in the bible it has nothing to do with fire      most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the english word hell to translate hades and sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice        why  because when seeing the word hell many readers impute to it the  traditional connotation of an everburning inferno when this was never  remotely intended in the greek language or in old english      in its true bibical usage hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of  the dead but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of  shadowy realm  hades is simply the abode we call the grave  all dead go to  this hell      the second hell of the bible tartaros is mentioned only once in  scripture 2 pet24 for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast  them down to hell tartaros and delivered them into chains of darkness to be  reserved unto judgment      following their rebellion to unseat god from his throne isa141214  rev124 the archangel lucifer now satan and a third of the created angels  now demons were ejected from heaven luke 1018  they were cast down to  tartaros a place or condition of restraint that god has imposed on the  mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment jude 6 1 cor63      tartaros then is a hell that applies only to evil rebellious angels or demons it is interesting that the ancient greeks used this word to describe  the place in which zeus confined the rebellious titans  nowhere in the bible  is there any mention of men being put into this particular hell      the the third word that is translated as hell in the bible is gehenna it comes from the hebrew gai hinnom meaning valley of hinniom  hinnom is a  deep narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of jerusalem      in old testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites including  infant sacrifice it was there that the apostate kings ahaz and manasseh made  their children pass through the fire to the god molech  the rites were  specifically celebrated in tophet the place of abhorrence one of the chief  groves in the valley      king josiah of ancient judah finally put an end to these abominations  he  defiled the valley rendering it ceremonially unclean 2 kings 2310  later  the valley became the cesspool and city dump of jerusalem a repository for  sewage refuse and animal carcasses  the bodies of dispised criminals were  also burned there along with the rubbish  fires burned continuously feeding  by a constant supply of garbage and refuse      aceldama the field of blood purchased with the money judas received for the betrayal of christ matt278 was also in part of the valley of hinnom      so what does this valley called gehenna have to do with hell        in rev1920 the satan inspired political dictator and a miracleworking  religious figure the false prophet working with him will resist the  reestablishment of the government of god by jesus christ at his second coming their fate is revealed by the apostle john and the beast was taken and with  him the false prophet  these both were cast alive into a lake of fire  burning with brimstone          where will this temporary lake of fire this hell be      the prophet isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the beast for  tophet in the valley of hinnom is ordained of old yea for the king it is  prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and wood  the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it isa3033      one thousand years later satan himself will be cast into this rekindled  fiery lake where the beast and false prophet were cast rev2010      but what of the wicked who have died over the millennia  does the bible  say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of  fire      in the sequence of rev20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be  thrown into the lake of fire after satan is cast there rev2015 what will  become of these wicked  will they writhe in flames for eternity        the wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming gehenna  fire on the earth  they wil be consumed annihilated destroyed  this  punishment will be everlasting permanent and final  the bible calls it the  second death rev2014 218 from which there is no possibility of a  further resurrection      the bible does teach eternal punishment but not eternal punishing                                 the prophet malachi provides a graphic description for behold the day  cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do  wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up 41  to the righteous god says that the wicked shall be ashes under the  soles of your feetmal43      gehenna was a place of destruction and death not a place of living  torture  jesus was talking to jews who understood all about this gehenna or  valley of hinnom  utter destruction by fire was complete  nothing was left  but ashes       every text in the bible translated from this greek word gehenna means  complete destruction not living torture not eternal life in torment  the  bible says in romans 623 the wages of sin is death not eternal life in  torture  the punishment revealed in the bible is death the cessation of  life           eternal life is the gift of god ,3

1291,1291,from ddaviscassma02bullcom dave davis subject re christian metaethics organization bull world wide information systems inc lines 117 distribution na nntppostinghost cassma02bullcom  russell turpin as is his wont has raised some interesting issues  in his struggle with the christian texts and the christians  unfortunately he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is  not available the lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable  result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such  as humanity   also unfortunately perhaps i have a deadline in two weeks the  responsibility for which prevents me in good conscience  from writing a more considered response and fully entering the fray as it were   let me then say what i can briefly    the two commandments are rules they are merely rules that are so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning    this point for the netbrowsers who also still read books is pursued throughly in kaufmann critiqueofreligionandphilosophy  the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed in part as reminding man that he is not god and cannot act as if he has ultimate responsibility   this is a theological statement worthy of barth dr turpin dd may wear the black robe of geneva yet   indeed many traditions present an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret loving ones neighbor as following various other rules and relying on their god to make things come out right precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate responsibility once again we are confronted with good sounding goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean   this requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among them i wouldnt make that assumption i dont think it is a reasonable assumption   and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted  there are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward reading show the christian god behaving in just this way  michael and i and others read the bible with christian glasses among the things that this should imply is that the nt informs the ot even to the point of dominanting it some points in the ot ceremonial  dietary laws are explicitly  abrogated by the nt texts to drive russell turpins point with adequacy one needs to begin with nt texts probably from matthew and probably about damnation just trying to help    this part is i discover what most moves me to post  mls i am a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously  no michael the conservative christians also take the gospel  seriously  what differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel  russell turpins no here is misplaced not to say inappropriate michaels selfdescription much govern  the equation of radical  liberal  which seems implied by russell turpin  is wrong  radical conservatives are  possible if sadly lacking in numbers at present thomas merton was a radical even though conservative in some ways st francis was a radical similarly how many examples are needed  mls  why dont i and the myriads of other christians like me mls tell you something about christianity   michaels question gets to a heart of the matter klingons have two hearts so my metaphor is not mixed just extraterrestrial   russell turpin in an earlier post had said that michael michaels theological positions actually didnt tell him much about christianity dean simeon responds this time gently what do you mean more direct perhaps would have been what could you possibly mean the implied rhetorical effort to separate michael from the  tradition is a failure michael is in the tradition if your idea of the tradition doesnt include him change your idea of the tradition  the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity per se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and gays    how can one answer this while staying on the more general issue im on the other side of the interpretive fence from michael on this issue yet nothing is a hideous overstatement  one verse is enough to refute it ill offer two from paul of all people  in jesus christ there is neither male nor femalegalatians 328 i dont quote single verses as a rule and i dont carry  them in my head and nothing shall separate us from the glory of god  roughly from romans if russell would promise to convert based on these or any other verses  id promise to get the full context for any that he requires    in short it is the extrachristian principles that make michaels christianity beneficial and i suspect they would be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by christian interpretation    this conclusion does not follow even in short from the argument that goes before a surprising logical ellipsis  dave davis ddavisma30bullcom these are my opinions  activities alone  qotd  wild beasts trapped in their

means thief      it only means thief if you want it to mean that  to me it means     lots of context wickedly omitted by myself       anyway if i say joe is a hacker to most english speaking people who  know the word theyll probably think he is either a poor golfer or a  bad carpenter but there are very very few people who will think he is  a good and clever programmer      if you chose to call yourself by a term that means thief dont be  surprised when people think you are a thief even if you dont agree  with that definition of the word               the narrower view that a hacker when   associated with the computing environment is a dishonest   expert is not so widespread im my opinion at least with the   people involved with the field imho the wider meaning is not   obsolete at all no matter how much the lay press would like it to   be      therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker and somebody   perceives you as a thief then this person belongs to a very very   small group that has some computer knowledge but not enough to know   the wider and original meaning of the word    unfortunately the general public has a very narrow view of the deep dark recesses of the art of computing  what little they do see is from the view given to them by the media  from what i have seen from the media hacker is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person  i on the other hand know what hacker means from those who consider themselves such  following is the definition from jargon file 2910 this is also known as the hackers dictionary  the definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage     hacker originally someone who makes furniture with an axe n      1 a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable      systems and how to stretch their capabilities as opposed to most      users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary  2 one who      programs enthusiastically even obsessively or who enjoys      programming rather than just theorizing about programming  3 a      person capable of appreciating hack value  4 a person who is      good at programming quickly  5 an expert at a particular program      or one who frequently does work using it or on it as in a unix      hacker  definitions 1 through 5 are correlated and people who      fit them congregate  6 an expert or enthusiast of any kind  one      might be an astronomy hacker for example  7 one who enjoys the      intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing      limitations  8 deprecated a malicious meddler who tries to      discover sensitive information by poking around  hence password      hacker network hacker  see cracker       the term hacker also tends to connote membership in the global      community defined by the net see network the and      internet address  it also implies that the person described      is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic see      hacker ethic the       it is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe      oneself that way  hackers consider themselves something of an      elite a meritocracy based on ability though one to which new      members are gladly welcome  there is thus a certain ego      satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker but if      you claim to be one and are not youll quickly be labeled      bogus  see also wannabee     hacker ethic the n  1 the belief that informationsharing      is a powerful positive good and that it is an ethical duty of      hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and      facilitating access to information and to computing resources      wherever possible  2 the belief that systemcracking for fun      and exploration is ethically ok as long as the cracker commits      no theft vandalism or breach of confidentiality       both of these normative ethical principles are widely but by no      means universally accepted among hackers most hackers subscribe      to the hacker ethic in sense 1 and many act on it by writing and      giving away free software  a few go further and assert that      all information should be free and any proprietary      control of it is bad this is the philosophy behind the gnu      project       sense 2 is more controversial some people consider the act of      cracking itself to be unethical like breaking and entering      but this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who      see themselves as benign crackers see also samurai  on      this view it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy      to a break into a system and then b explain to the sysop      preferably by email from a superuser account exactly how it      was done and how the hole can be plugged  acting as an      unpaid an unsolicited tiger team       the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker      ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share      technical tricks software and where possible computing      resources with other hackers  huge cooperative networks such as      usenet fidonet and internet see internet address      can function without central control because of this trait they      both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be      hackerdoms most valuable intangible asset    finally a true hacker does not name himselfherself one for this is   a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large  to me a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who  says nahh i just know a thing or two people always exagerate   note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself meaning himselfherself one but simply says that it is better not to do so  there are many who do not know the meaning of hacker  so in order to defend the true meaning of the word it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known respected hacker around the workplace  this means that hacker is defined in terms of some wellknown and respected person  sometimes there may only be one such person   no matter what mr dumpty says language doesnt work that way   actually it does you just have to get adequate press coverage   language works anyway that we want it to work  the purpose of language is to communicate  to oversimplify as long as communication is taking place

my own actions not abu hanifa or imam malik etc  even if i am blindly following the opinions of abu hanifa etc    with this in mind to my understanding we must look at the reasoning  behind such opinions of muslims that support khomeinis fatwa  now to  my understanding the hadith upon which those who support khomeinis  fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war  time  now brother in general it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say  that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of  peace  i think any sensible human being can see this so i personally  think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty  for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace  regarding this particular subject    if you think i am wrong please feel free to say so with your  reasoning from quran and hadith please  not because somebody said  so i want the reasoning from alquran and the sahih hadiths    perhaps we should take our discussion to socreligionislam  please  email me rashid if you think we should do this     by the way i also disagree with your opinion regarding the punishment  for apostasy  the viewpoint i follow  that there is in general no  punishment for apostasy  is very strongly supported by quran and  hadith  this is very well shown in the book punishment in islamic law  by mohamed s elawa american trust publications 1981    i reiterate that i would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the quran in islamic history as well apostasy has rarely been punished  belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will  however when an apostate makes attacks upon god and his messenger the situation changes now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges  perhaps  charges of sedition treason spying etc if the person  makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks as opposed to arguement against islam the situation is likewise complicated if the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods again the situation changes the punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in anyhow the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in rushdies case  there is a distinction in the quran between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war by their actions creates disorder makes mischiefetc  against the muslims and creates a situation that results in harm  to muslims here a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise in other words there is a clear difference between a formal war situation where two clearly defined parties wage war conclude treaties exchange prisoners etc and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against islam it is the second situation  the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that  would apply in the case of rushdie  the matter of rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an  offensive book banning the book is secondary  a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well including the deaths of many muslims and rushdies and his publishers media games    now i do not believe in blindly following anyone no matter  how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law  if someone tells me  islam says such and such i immediately say show me the support for  this statement from the quran and sunnah  i believe this to be my  islamic duty for according to one hadith of the prophet peace and  blessings of god be with him if your leader tells you to enter a fire  and you do it and kill yourself then you have sinned for doing   wrong even though you  were blindly following the instructions of your leader  i am  responsible for

relating to a particular instance that occurred during war  time  now brother in general it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say  that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of  peace  i think any sensible human being can see this so i personally  think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty  for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace  regarding this particular subject  i am not sure which hadith you are referring to above i believe that one of the quranic verses on which the fatwa is based is 533 every verse in the quran has a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way is the understanding the tafsir of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed if this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the muslims were not involved in conflict should be suspended when they were at war the logic does not follow in complex reallife situations there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single complicated situation the internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task it is not necessarily a simple this or that process there may be many parameters involved there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed all these matters impinge on the situation  in other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the quran the quran asks us to reflect on its verses but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith if the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that however if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the state to the gestation of laws and rulings to the gestation of society the dispensing of justice the guidance of the community then there  are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one  should achieve jaffar ibn muhammad assadiqas relates some of  these requirements as taught by the prophetsa in a hadith  he who does not distinguish in the book of allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguous and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and does not recognize a verse of meccan period from a medinite one and does not know the circumstances  of revelation and does not understand the technical words of the quran whether simple or compound and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and is ignorant of advancing and delaying in its verses and does not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the beginning from the termination and is unaware of the question and the answer the disjoining and the joining and the exceptions and the allinclusive and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one the obligatory laws and the permissions the places of the duties and rules and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful and does not know the joined words and the words that are related to those coming before them or after them  then such a man does not know the quran nor is he among the people of the quran  based on these and other hadiths and in accordance with many quranic verses why should not a company from every group remain behind  to gain profound understanding tafaqquh in religion and to warn  people when they return to them so that they may beware 9122 a science of jurisprudence arose the requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion are many ive listed a few major  divisions below  there are of course many subdivisions within these headings   knowledge of arabic syntax conjugation roots semantics oratory  knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir  logic mantiq  a knowledge of hadiths  a knowledge of transmitters rijal  knowledge of the principles of juriprudence quran sunnah consensus reasoning  the study of quran and sunnah for purposes of law involves  discussion of imperatives awamir  discussion of negative imperatives nawahi  discussion of generalities and particularities aam wa khas  discussion of unconditional and conditional  discussion of tacit meanings  discussion of the abstract and the clear  discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated  the principles of application of the law involves  principles of exemption  principles of precaution  principles of option  principles of mastery  the jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation it is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith   now no one should blindly follow anyone but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself there is the famous hadith of the prophet sa in which he says the fuqaha religious scholars are the trustees of the prophet as  long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires pleasures and wealth of this world the prophet sa was asked o messenger of god how may we know if they so concern themselves he sa replied by seeing whether they follow the ruling power if they do that fear for your religion and shun them i do not yet know enough about the imams of the four sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them  the prophet also refered to the fuqaha as the fortress of islam my only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise  the specifics of this expertise is  delineated in the quran and hadith those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the quran and hadith  those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society state and religion  are cautioned  the only reason i said anything at all about the rushdie affair in this group is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa that is apostasy was wrong when one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact secondly khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible  another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him   perhaps we should take our discussion to socreligionislam  please  email me rashid if you think we should do this  i agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup unfortunately i do not have any access to email so private discussion or a moderated group is out of the question i

belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism   deletion   theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it  imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered   bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor  thats your claim now back it up  i consider your argument as useful as the following  belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism  therefore belief is a factor in fanaticism  true and utterly useless  note this is any belief not belief in gods  gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators  and the really dangerous people  the sources of fanaticism  are often none of these things  they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing   thats a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say  if you believe that youre incredibly naive  now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you  to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument  and it reads to me like a warmup for censorship and restriction of religious freedom  ever read animal farm  thats a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism  no some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some fanaticism    your last statement simply isnt implied by what you say before because youre trying to sneak in innate features of all theism  the word youre groping for is some  gullibility by the way is one of them  no shit sherlock  so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make  and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer  i said it reads like a warm up to that  thats because its an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice themus  split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls  2  define irrational belief  eg is it rational to believe that      reason is always useful   irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information  well there is a glaring paradox here  an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational  which is it  thats bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed  ok its oval  its still begging the question however  and though that certainly is allowed its not rational  and you claiming to be rational and all  at the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didnt hear a refutation before so were back   deal with it  you cant use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful  someone who thinks reason is crap wont buy it you see  your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular  anybody else think godel was silly  the first part of the second statement contains no information because you dont say what the beliefs are  if the beliefs are strong theism andor strong atheism then your statement is not in general true  the second part of your sentence is patently false  counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it    ive been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here   an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way  further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms   what is it you are trying to say  that at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable  for no particular reason at all  example i am not dreaming  compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational  i cant agree with this until you are specific  which theism  to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have    using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals andor the way the world works  imo any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational  that does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of intelligence  some atheists are also scientists for example  the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis  i dont understand this  can you formalise your argument   person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste  of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekitesidolatersprotestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects  peculiar definition of interesting but sure  now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak   why arent my  catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example   maybe they  dont believe in it  maybe its the conjunction of b asserts b and jailkill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant  it certainly seems so to me but then i have no axe to grind here
