9304141210197e4rusnewsw165wmantiscouk mathew mathewmantiscouk writes  yes  fortunately we have rightthinking folks like your good self in power  and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds o  thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oilhhhkuwait  we won the war  hurrah hurrah    the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and   exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media  the  facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians   in any other war of comparable size this century    lets analyze this claim a little  how is the size of a war defined  by  number of participants  geographical area  number of countries involved   number of casualties  size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries too are all measures of size  in this case id say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area     which other comparable wars are we talking about  vietnam and korea might make good comparisons     which liberal news media are we talking about    western news in general but in particular the american mass media cbs nbc abc etc  the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits                                                      this was due mostly  to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques  which were technically possible only recently    i suspect that medical advances may have something to do with it too  i agree     how about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in ww2  i dont hear you bemoaning them    perhaps because the topic hasnt cropped up  if you want my opinion i think  that the blanket bombing of german cities at the end of world war two was the  most appalling act of wholesale slaughter this country has committed in  centuries  bomber harris was no hero of mine  perhaps so  and maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too  but thats easy to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the 90s right  back then it was allout war and germany and japan had to be squashed after all a million or more british had already died hundreds of  thousands of french a couple hundread thousand or so americans and  millions of russians not to mention a few million jews poles and  other people of slavic descent in german concentration camps  all  things considered the firebombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses  i for one dont regret it                                     war is never an exact science but  with smart bombs its becoming more exact with a smaller percentage  of civilian casualties  sometimes mistakes are made targets are  misidentified innocents die  thats war the way it really is    entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests without  regard for the lives of other people that is the way war really is  sure  and its the people who suffer because of them  all the more reason to depose these entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests  or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well     why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet  if  iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before  we started bombing  i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war  it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically  but once hussein invaded kuwait and  threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the worlds oil supply he had to be stopped  sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the west before hussein invaded kuwait but it is still hussein who is responsible for his decision to invade  and once he did so a strong response from the west was required     mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely offbase here  you come off sounding like a complete peacenik idiot although i  feel sure that was not your intent    whats your intent  to sound like a loving christian  well you arent  doing a very good job of it  well its not very loving to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them  or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion  so id have to say yes stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest    so the iraqi war was wrong eh  im sure that appeasement would have  worked better than war just like it did in ww2 eh    who even mentioned appeasement  and what makes you think the situation is  even remotely analogous to world war two  i mentioned it  if we hadnt intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement  it is precisely the lessons the world learned in ww2 that motivated the western alliance to war  letting hitler take austria and czechoslavkia did not stop ww2 from happening and letting hussein keep kuwait would not have stopped an eventual gulf war to protect saudi arabia                                                               i guess we  shouldnt have fought ww2 either  just think of all those innocent  german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg    yes do  germans are human too you know    sure  what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for a thousand year reich  the consequences stemmed from that   tyrants like hussein have to be stopped  his kind dont understand  diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun  my only regret is  that bush wimped out and didnt have the military roll into baghdad so  now hussein is still in power and the iraqi peoples sacrifice not to  mention the 357 americans who died was for naught    i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and tibet   what should i say about them  anything in particular    and as for poor poor rodney king  did you ever stop and think why  the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty    yes  amongst the things i thought were hmm theres an awful lot of white  people in that jury  so  it was the policemen on trial not rodney king  and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers  if there had been black officers involved im sure their would have been black jurors too this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow     those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those  policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape  but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i  have not seen    when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone whos lying defenceless on  the ground its rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have  been  so  its hard to imagine  so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing a logical argument  can we expect another revision soon    just kidding     if there is some wonderful evidence why is it seemingly being kept secret   why not tell everyone what it is  then everyone could say oh yes youre  right king deserved a good beating and we could all live happily ever  after  i have to admit that i wonder this too  but neither the prosecution nor the defense is talking  so one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principals       law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused  whether they be criminals or cops  one is not found guilty if there is  a reasonable doubt of ones guilt and only the jury is in a position  to assess the evidence and render a verdict    fine but im still finding it hard to imagine what the reasonable doubt  was in this case  i mean the cops certainly seem to be beating someone  whos lying defenceless on the ground  whats your explanation  mass  hallucination  orbital mindcontrol lasers  faked video footage  do tell    ok  it certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved and frankly the original not guilty verdict baffled me too  but then i learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm  a charge which news commentators said was akin to attempted murder under california law  based on what the prosecution was asking for its evident that  the first jury decided that the officers were not guilty  note  not not guilty of doing wrong but not guilty of aggravated assault  with the intent of inflicting serious bodily harm  the seeds of the  prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a  verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could  if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one     mathew   thou shalt not kill unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing     in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way     as unfortunately it cannot be helped                                      jim brown bible for loving christians   thanks mathew i like the quote  pretty funny actually  im a  monty python fan you know  kind of seems in that vein  of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory  but then you know that already    regards  jim b loving christian    ,0

24,24,from rwscsarizonaedu ronald w schmidt subject outlining of spline surface keywords spline rasterization lines 38   9about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult  i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published  solutions to it  9the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines  for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional ie only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space  to draw  the object we   1 fit a cubic spline through the points  each spline is effectively 9computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve  each spline has an equal number of segments  we assume 9that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not 9exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable 9measure 2 take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment 9of the opposing spline  use the pair of segments to form two 9triangles which will be filled in to color the surface 3 depth sort the triangles 4 take each triangle in sorted order project onto a 2d pixmap draw 9and color the triangle  take the edge of the triangle that is 9along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge 9colored with a special edge color  9it is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem  the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface  the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines  if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area  thanks ,1

just out in dahlgren last month  im the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics so perhaps i can help a little  in article 1993mar1718572513487relaynswcnavymil rchuinswcwonswcnavymil raymond chui writes  hello the real reality our agency started to express interest in  virtual realityvr  so far we do not know much about vr  all we  know about are the hollywood movies the terminater 2 and lawnmover  man  we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and  computer graphics world magazine   unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects for both terminator 2 and lawnmower man those are filmquality computer graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time  each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on highend parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time 30 frames per second      we certainly want to know more about vr  who are the leading  companies  agencies universities  what machines support vr ie sgi sun4  hp9000 bim6000 etc   it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second  this is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous  thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations  additionally the frame rate must be constant  if the system renders 15 frames per second at one point then 60 frames per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in realtime  unix in general does not support realtime operation but silicon graphics has modified the unix kernel for its multiprocessor systems to be able to support realtime operation bypassing the usual unix process prioritymanagement schemes  uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support realtime operation not sun sparc10 not hp 700 series systems not ibm rs6000 not even sgis uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support realtime operation due to their symmetric multiprocessing smp sharedmemory architecture  from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and realtime multisample antialiasing  of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine2 systems fully support these capabilities the antialiasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment     what kind of graphics languages are used with vr  gl opengl phigs pex gks etc  you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop vr applications but that is starting at a pretty low level there are offthe shelf software packages available to get you going much faster being targeted directly at the vr application developer some of

blowing up skyscrapers next  i dont know if you are doing so but it seems you are implying  1 that the person accused of blowing up the wtc in ny actually did it and 2 that islamic teachings have something to do with blowing up the wtc  wtc  world trade centre which was the building that was blown up i think  okay to make some comments  1 the person has only been accused  innocent until proven guilty remember  secondly there seem to be some holes in his accusation that i read about  for instance if they guy used that particular van to blow up the building and then to go back and claim his deposit back afterwards he must be incredibly stupid    perhaps salamen was one of those uneducated muslims we hear so much about  nevertheless he was apparently smart enough to put together a very sophisticated bomb  it doesnt seem to fit together somehow    actually salameh was not the only person involved  the other fellow was a chemical engineer working for allied signal who had specifically studied explosive devices in school believe it or not  we actually allow radical muslim types to study things like this in our universities  so much for the price of freedom  from what i read the other fellow told salameh how to put it together over the phone  the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a i assume complicated sophisticated bomb together from instructions over the phone  one must need some brains i would expect  despite this there have already been many attacks and threats against mosques and muslims in the united states as a consequence of his accusation i have read   ok now please tell us where this is happening  i live in the us and i have heard very little about these mosque attacks  there are many mosques in houston texas and i would like to know what is going on so i can verify this  or is the great jewish media conspiracy keeping us from knowing about this in the us  we heard about the mosque attacks during the desert storm venture so why is it so quiet now  maybe it is localized to new jersey  i read this in an article in the australian muslim times the newspaper weekly of the australian muslim community    if this is true perhaps one of the muslims based in north america if they see this posting can elaborate  2 islamic teachings teach against harming the innocent  in the quran it explicitly teaches against harming innocents even in times of war the blowing up of the wtc and harming innocents is therefore in blatant contradiction to islamic teachings  this means absolutely nothing  plenty of people commit violence while  following what they think are valid religious principles  i have seen people post many things here from the koran which could be misinterpreted if that is the explanation you wish to use by an uneducated muslim to allow them to harm idolators and unbelievers  the first thing every muslim says is that no muslim could have done that because islam teaches against harming innocents  and we are supposed to take you word that it never happens   what do you think is the consequence  does allah strike them down before the alleged violence occurs  of course not  muslims commit the violent act and then everyone hides behind verses in the koran  were pretty hip to that trick  and i even doubt that it will come up in the trials    my defense is that i am muslim and islam teaches me not to harm the innocent therefore the people who were killed must not have been innocent  sure we set off the bomb your honor but you must remember sir i am a muslim allah is allpowerful  allah would not have allowed this  are you insulting my religion  great defense eh  just admit that there are some incredibly stupid violent muslims in the  world and stop hiding from that fact  it does no one any good to deny it it only makes the more reasonable muslims look like they are protecting the bad ones  can you see that  i dont deny this fact  the thrust of my argument here is that   a salameh is according to us law innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law  as his guilt has not been established it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption  b islam teaches us not to harm innocents  if muslims  who perhaps have not realized that islam teaches this  perform such actions it is not because of the teachings of islam but rather in spite of and in contradiction to the  teachings of islam  this is an important  distinction  i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say muslim  in general anyone who calls themselves a muslim and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam is considered to be a muslim  thus one who might do things contrary to islam through ignorance for example does not suddenly not become a muslim  if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential principles though then one does leave islam  the term muslim is to be contrasted with mumin which means true believer  however whether a muslim is in reality a mumin is something known only by god and perhaps that person himself  so you will not find the term mumin used very much by muslims in altatheism because it is not known to anybody except myself and god whether i for example am a true believer or not  for example i could just be putting on a show here and in

replied to my letter with  ra in article c5elp2l0cacsubuffaloedu ra psyrobtwubvmsbccbuffaloedu robert weiss says ra ra      well jason its heretical in a few ways the first point is that ra      this equates lucifer and jesus as being the same type of being ra      however lucifer is a created being thou wast perfect in thy ra      ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in ra      thee ezekiel 2815 while jesus is uncreated and the creator of ra      all things in the beginning was the word and the word was with ra      god and the word was god  the same was in the beginning with god ra      all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made ra      that was made john 113 and he is before all things and by ra      him all things consist colossians 117 ra ra    your inference from the ezekiel and john passages that lucifer was ra created and that jesus was not depends on a particular interpetation of ra the word create  one with which many christians may not agree ra granted the mormon belief that all of gods children including christ ra and lucifer are eternally existent intelligences which were organized ra into spirit children by god the term creation can apply equally well ra to both of those passages       just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing you refer to      differing interpretations of create and say that many christians may      not agree so what that is really irrelevant we do not base our faith      on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line is      truth regardless of popularity of opinions       also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created      and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the mormon      belief you cant grant your conclusion and then expect the point to      have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address      and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the      conclusion that you grant       the bible states that lucifer was created  the bible states that jesus      is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds      belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same  ra      your point that we all are brothers of jesus and lucifer is also ra      heretical since we are not innately brothers and sisters of christ ra      we are adopted for ye have not received the spirit of bondage ra      again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby ra      we cry abba father romans 815 and not the natural children ra      of god it is only through faith that we even enter the family of ra      god for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus ra      galatians 326 and it is only through the manifestation of this ra      faith in receiving jesus that we are become the sons of god  but ra      as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of ra      god even to them that believe on his name which were born not ra      of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but ra      of god john 11213 ra ra    has it occured to you robert that being born of someone or being ra of that person or persons family may be a symbolic term in the new ra testament  mormons believe that we are adopted into the house of ra israel through baptism and faith in christ although some have expressed ra belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies       the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is      nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible      says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god            the field is the world the good seed are the children of the            kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one           matthew 1338            i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which            ye have seen with your father john 838            ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not            born of fornication we have one father even god  jesus said            unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i            proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he            sent me  why do ye not understand my speech even because ye            cannot hear my word  ye are of your father the devil and the            lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the            beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in            him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a            liar and the father of it john 84144            and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of            the devil thou enemy of all

he power to become the           sons of god even to them that believe on his name john 112            behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that           we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us           not because it knew him not  beloved now are we the sons of god           and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when           he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he           is 1 john 312       when he is born again through faith in jesus christ            which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of           the will of man but of god john 113            having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus           christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will           ephesians 15            of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should           be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures james 118            for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of           god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear           but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we

every one           that loveth is born of god and knoweth god 1 john 47            whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and           every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is           begotten of him 1 john 51            for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus           galatians 326  ra      we are told that and this is life eternal that they might know ra      thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent ra      john 173 life eternal is to know the only true god yet the ra      doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly ra      different jesus a jesus that cannot be reconciled with the jesus of ra      the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim ra      one as being true denies the other from being true according to the ra      bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god and ra      not the construct of imagination ra ra ra    robert with all due respect who died and left you chief arbiter of ra correct biblical interpretation  i dont mean to be snotty about this ra but the fact is that the bible is so differently interpreted by different ra groups of biblical scholars what do you think of the jehovahs ra witnesses for example that to make reference to the jesus of the ra bible is simply ridiculous  whose jesus of the bible do you mean       this is really a red herring it doesnt address any issue raised but       rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read       something into the bible doesnt change what the bible teaches for       example the fact that the jehovahs witnesses deny the deity of christ       does not alter what the bible teaches  looking for that blessed hope      and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus      christ titus 213simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus      christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through      the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ 2 peter 11       on the deity of christ       we first look to the bible to see what it teaches to discount or not       even address what the bible teaches because there are some groups that       have differing views is selfdefeating to see what the bible teaches       you have to look at the bible  ra      our lords mortality was essential to his own salvation the ra      promised messiah p 456 he had to work out his own salvation by ra      doing the will of the father in all things ibid p54 he had ra      to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom mormon ra      doctrine p71 ra ra    welcome to the wonderful world of mormon paradoctrine robert  the ra above books are by the late bruce r mcconkie a former general authority ra of the lds church  those books were not published by the church nor do ra they constitute offical doctrine  they consist of his opinions  now ra does that mean that what he says is not true  not at all ill have to ra think about the idea of christs personal salvation before i come to any ra conclusions myself  the conclusions i come to may seem heretical to ra you but im prepared to accept that       i find this rather curious when i mentioned that the mormon belief is      that jesus needed to be saved i put forward some quotes from the late      apostle bruce mcconkie the curious part is that no one addressed the      issue of jesus needing to be saved rick comes the closest with his i      have my own conclusions to addressing the point       most of the other replies have instead hopscotched to the issue of      bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine i dont      think that it matters if mcconkies views were canon that is not the      issue  were mcconkies writings indicative of mormon belief on this      subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may       certainly be    robert weiss

1993 version 14                         constructing a logical argument  although there is much argument on usenet the general quality of argument found is poor  this article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate  logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference concise oed  logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid  of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument  note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable  the matter is very much open for debate  this document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job  propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical argument a proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example it is raining or today is tuesday  propositions may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false  note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning  the proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express it  so god exists and there exists a god both express the same proposition  an argument is to quote the monty python sketch a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition  an argument consists of three stages  first of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated  these are called the premises of the argument  they are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions   premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as because since obviously and so on  the phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises  if something doesnt seem obvious to you dont be afraid to question it  you can always say oh yes youre right it is obvious when youve heard the explanation  next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference  in inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted  there are various forms of valid inference  the propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference  inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore  finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument  the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference  conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude and so on  the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference  for example  every event has a cause premise the universe has a beginning premise all beginnings involve an event premise this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion  note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument  a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolation  sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion  this is perfectly valid if  sometimes a little confusing  recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions  many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument  some statements look like arguments but are not  for example  if the bible is accurate jesus must either have been insane an evil liar  or the son of god  this is not an argument it is a conditional statement  it does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion  it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but well come to those later  another example  god created you therefore do your duty to god  the phrase do your duty to god is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false  therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument  finally causality is important  consider a statement of the form a because b  if were interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence the statement is an argument  if were trying to establish the truth of b then it is not an argument it is an explanation  for example  there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not  start  this is an argument  my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine   this is an explanation  there are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive  a deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions  that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true  a deductive argument is either valid or invalid  a valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is true  an inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion  inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are  there are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive  however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing  it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds  this is because of the slightly  counterintuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully  obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions  however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions  for example     all insects have wings premise    woodlice are insects premise    therefore woodlice have wings conclusion  here the conclusion is not true because the arguments premises are false  if the arguments premises were true however the conclusion would be true  the argument is thus entirely valid  more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in     all fish live in the sea premise    dolphins are fish premise    therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion  however the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises  we can therefore draw up a truth table for implication  the symbol  denotes implication a is the premise b the conclusion  t and f represent true and false respectively  premise conclusion inference    a        b        ab     f        f         t      if the premises are false and the inference    f        t         t      valid the conclusion can be true or false     t        f         f      if the premises are true and the conclusion                              false the inference must be invalid     t        t         t      if the premises are true and the inference valid                              the conclusion must be true  a sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true  a sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion  be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments  to delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy  it is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument  these pitfalls are known as fallacies  in everyday english the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs  this is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing  so for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely  by studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them  the following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive  argumentum ad baculum appeal to force  the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion  it is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right  the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer  for example  thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible  all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell  argumentum ad hominem  argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man  the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion  this is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it  for example atheism is an evil philosophy  it is practised by communists and murderers  sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing for example that he is a known perjurer  this is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witnesss testimony is false  to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list  the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponents particular circumstances  for example it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food  how can you argue otherwise when youre quite happy to wear leather shoes  this is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponents argument  this fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion  for  example  of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing  youre white  this particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one alleges that ones adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as poisoning the well  argumentum ad ignorantium  argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance  this fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false  or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true  note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific principle  examples of course the bible is true  nobody can prove otherwise  of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist  nobody has shown any proof that they are real  note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty  also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur  for example  a flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth  the earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles  therefore no such flood occurred  in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred  we cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however  argumentum ad misericordiam  this is the appeal to pity also known as special pleading  the fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted  for example  i did not murder my mother and father with an axe  please dont find me guilty im suffering enough through being an orphan  argumentum ad populum  this is known as appealing to the gallery or appealing to the people  to commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people  this form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language  for example  pornography must be banned  it is violence against women  the bible must be true  millions of people know that it is  are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools  argumentum ad numeram  this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum  it consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct  argumentum ad verecundiam  the appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion  for example  isaac newton was a genius and he believed in god  this line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject  for example we can distinguish quite clearly between  stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and john searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer  hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed  searle is a linguist so it is questionable  whether he is wellqualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence  the fallacy of accident  the fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable  it is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific  for example  christians generally dislike atheists  you are a christian so you must dislike atheists  this fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules  converse accident  hasty generalization  this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident  it occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases  for example jim bakker was an insincere christian  therefore all christians are insincere  sweeping generalization  dicto simpliciter  a sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable  a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization  non causa pro causa  post hoc ergo propter hoc  these are known as false cause fallacies  the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause  for  example  i took an aspirin and prayed to god and my headache disappeared  so god cured me of the headache  the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event  for  example  the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism  therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons  cum hoc ergo propter hoc  this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc  it asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the causes of the events  petitio principii  this fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached  circulus in demonstrando  this fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach  often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument  for example  homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office  hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job  therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail  therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office  note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the  conclusion  an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the british secret services official ban on homosexual employees  another example is the classic  we know that god exists because the bible tells us so  and we know that the bible is true because it is the word of god  complex question  fallacy of interrogation  this is the fallacy of presupposition  one example is the classic loaded  question  have you stopped beating your wife  the question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked  this trick is often used by lawyers in crossexamination when they ask questions like  where did you hide the money you stole  similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as  how long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continue or does the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization  ignoratio elenchi  the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion  for example a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of christianity are undoubtably true  if he then argues at length that christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that christian teachings are true  sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light  equivocation  equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument  for example  what could be more affordable than free software  but to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable  amphiboly  amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing  accent  accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning  in this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized  for example consider  we should not speak ill of our friends and we should not speak ill of our friends  fallacies of composition  one fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole  for example  the bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very  lightweight  the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items  for example  a car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus  therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses  fallacy of division  the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition  like its opposite it exists in two varieties  the first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts  for example  you are studying at a rich college  therefore you must be rich  the other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item  for example  ants can destroy a tree  therefore this ant can destroy a tree  the slippery slope argument  this argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful events  there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event  for example if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and well have a nation full of drugaddicts on welfare  therefore we cannot legalize marijuana  a is based on b fallacies  is a type of fallacies  these fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar  examples isnt history based upon faith  if so then isnt the bible also a form of history  islam is based on faith christianity is based on faith so isnt islam a form of christianity  cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so arent dogs a form of cat  affirmation of the consequent  this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b b is true therefore a is true  to understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier  denial of the antecedent  this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false  again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy  note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa the latter has the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false where a does not in fact imply b at all  here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce anything about b  converting a conditional  this fallacy is an argument of the form if a then b therefore if b then a  argumentum ad antiquitam  this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because thats the way its always been  argumentum ad novitam  this is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else  argumentum ad crumenam  the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right  argumentum ad lazarum  the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier  this fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam  argumentum ad nauseam  this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard  an argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something  bifurcation  also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist  plurium interrogationum  many questions  this fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question  non sequitur  a nonsequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it  red herring  this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyones attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different conclusion  reification  hypostatization  reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing  shifting the burden of proof  the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition  shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made  the source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise  straw man  the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone elses position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished  it is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made  the extended analogy  the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over  the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other  this fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anticryptography legislation  i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it  such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported  martin luther king  are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for black liberation  how dare you  tu quoque  this is the famous you too fallacy  it occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it  for instance  youre just being randomly abusive so  youve been abusive too  ÿ ,0

nntppostinghost syndicootenginumichedu  in article 1993apr2155057808batmanbmdtrwcom jbrownbatmanbmdtrwcom writes why do babies get diseases etc what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve  without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism   heres the main problem the scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only does not support it but indicates something far different the earth by latest estimates is about 46 billion years old and has had life for about 35 billion of those years humans have only been around for at most about 200000 years but the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving and in fact diseaseridden long before there were people yes there are fossils that show signs of disease mostly bone disorders of course but there are some heck not just fossil evidence but what weve been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long long time if human sin was what brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before humans                               god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw  and without getting sidetracked into the theological ramifications of the original sin the main effect of the socalled original sin for this discussion was to remove humanity from gods protection since by their choice ae cut themselves off from intimate fellowship with god  in addition their sin caused them to come under the dominion of satan who then assumed dominion over the earth deletions since humanity was no longer under gods protection but under satans dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterialviral and genetic  although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this     uh i know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this there is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other started off in perfect condition it seems to adapt to its envionment in a collective sense im really curious as to what you mean by the degeneration of the genetic code  human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our wellbeing and ability to fight off disease while the  simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  causing infection and disease  it is a bad combination   umm nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria and they to us only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size but the ranks keep changing for example bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease im sure youll agree but it still pops up from time to time even today and doesnt do as much damage part of that is because of better sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago and because the really nasty variants overgrazed forgive the poor terminology im an engineer not a doctor   and died off for lack of nearby hosts  i could be wrong on this but from what i gather acne is only a few hundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer it seems to be getting less nasty wage                                                            hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseasesdisorders   now wait a minute i have a question humans were created perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it seems unlikely that satan whos making the diseases would also gift humans with the means to fight them off simpler to make the diseases less lethal if he wants survivors as far as i can see our immune systems imperfect though they may presently be must have been built into us by god i want to be clear on this are you saying that god was planning ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not at the time of design necessary that is god made our immune systems ahead of time knowing that adam and eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases  this may be more of a mysticalsupernatural explanation than you are prepared to accept but god is not responsible for disease even if satan had nothing to do with the original inception of disease evolution by random chance would have produced them since humanity forsook gods protection   heres another puzzle what exactly do you mean by perfect in the phrase created perfect and without flaw to my mind a perfect system would be incapable of degrading over time a perfect system that will without constant intervention become imperfect is not a perfect system at least imho  or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with elmers glue that is the original genetic instructions were perfect but were written in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart if so why could god not have used better materials  was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself of did it just choose not to  deletions in summary newborns are innocent but god does not cause their suffering   my main point as i said was that there really isnt any evidence for the explanation you give at least that im aware of but i couldnt help making a few nitpicks here and there   sincerely  ray ingles                   the above opinions are probably

conventional large  vhf radars in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed  to individual antenna elements each of 475 solid state power amplifier  feeds each antenna element this

127,127,from turpincsutexasedu russell turpin subject re christian metaethics organization cs dept university of texas at austin lines 121 nntppostinghost saltillocsutexasedu summary spit out the lukewarm   in article c5jzz79g7panixcom mlspanixcom michael siemon writes  well the whole point of making these the base commandments is that  they arent reducible to rules  a set of rules is a moral code or a  law code or an algorithm for acting  such things can be very helpful  to individuals or societies  but not if they are used instead of a  personal involvement in and responsibility for ones actions   the two commandments are rules they are merely rules that are so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning  michael siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural assumptions that are independent of these rules     the great  commandment is more than anything else a call  to act as if you were god and accepting ultimate responsibility  in your every action   the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed in part as reminding man that he is not god and cannot act as if he has ultimate responsibility indeed many traditions present an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret loving ones neighbor as following various other rules and relying on their god to make things come out right precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate responsibility once again we are confronted with good sounding goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean     conservatives may twist this act as if you were god to   mean lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them  as possible if they dont keep your rules  they are so  insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced a  lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such   idiocy is how god acts   and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted  there are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward reading show the christian god behaving in just this way michael cannot refer to base claims or base commandments to show that such readings are twisted because this divergence in understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the base claims and commandments  in addressing conservative christians michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions that these conservative christians will reject     but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system since our  society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do  it  may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems   in which case i will profer the agapate allelou once again  but these base commandments are too vague to serve as  a principle for the critique of ethical systems the meaning of these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular and cultural notions that the believer brings to them from how the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of other biblical passages from a particular sectarian tradition or from some combination of these things  these commandments lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for criticizing ethical systems  what meaning they have comes from the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments    and different bodies of christians have from the beginning urged  different ethical systems or in some cases none  as a result  it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popular  or infamous with christianity  christianity does not have a torah  it does not have a quran  specifically christian scripture has very  little if anything in the way of commandments  so little that  the christians who desperately want commandments go mining for  them with almost no support  the one single thing in the gospels  which jesus specifically gives as a commandment to us is love  one another  jesus explicitly states that this summarizes jewish law which would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what it means to love god and love our neighbors  there are many parables and teachings the gospels attribute to jesus that are straightforwardly read as ethical commandments  the pauline epistles are similarly full  if it is not clear that these all come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior the problem is not a lack of raw material     i am a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously  no michael the conservative christians also take the gospel  seriously  what differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel    why dont i and the myriads of other christians like me  tell you something about christianity   in a sense the wide variety of interpretations does tell us something about christianity  it tells us that the new testament authors left a sufficiently vague hodgepodge that it can serve as the source text for many vastly different beliefs about the nature of the christian god and about what men should and shouldnt do   the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity per se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and gays  every christian principle he turns to this cause is effective only through the extrachristian principles through which michael interprets his religion and the homophobes apply the same christian principles with equal justification to their cause  in short it is the extrachristian principles that make michaels christianity beneficial and i suspect they would be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by christian interpretation    michael paints a picture of standard american atheism as the rejection of the evil in many conservative christian interpretations of the bible  but i think it is even more damaging to christianity to note that the new testament presents such a vague hodgepodge of notions about the nature of god and the nature of the good except of course when it is ordered by an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles  here i think we should apply a christian parable where a cold drink can have its value and a hot drink can have its value but the lukewarm we should spit out   russell ,3

orbiters      mariner 1 the first us attempt to send a spacecraft to venus failed     minutes after launch in 1962 the guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the     onboard computer took control however there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the     range safety officer destroyed it although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect fortran do statement it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing was omitted     from the expression rdotbar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius this error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation      mariner 2 became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december     of 1962 and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a     very hot 800 degrees fahrenheit now revised to 900 degrees f world     with a cloudcovered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978      mariner 3 launched on november 5 1964 was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space unable to collect the suns energy for power from its solar     panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner 4      mariner 4 the sister probe to mariner 3 did reach mars in 1965 and     took the first closeup images of the martian surface 22 in all as it     flew by the planet the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that mars was a dead world in both the     geological and biological sense      mariner 5 was sent to venus in 1967 it reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by mariner 2 plus the information     that venus atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of earths or the equivalent of being 3300 feet under the surface     of an ocean      mariner 6 and 7 were sent to mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by mariner 4 four years earlier however they failed to take away     the concept of mars as a dead planet first made from the basic     measurements of mariner 4      mariner 8 ended up in the atlantic ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed      mariner 9 the sister probe to mariner 8 became the first craft to     orbit mars in 1971 it returned information on the red planet that no     other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the martian     surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of mars two small moons phobos and deimos      mariner 10 used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in 1974 the probe     did return the first closeup images of the venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     earth days mariner 10 eventually made three flybys of mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas the probe revealed     mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet       pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiters      pioneer 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective  to photograph     the moon closeup  but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between earth and the moon including new     data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth all three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers pioneer 1 was launched on     october 11 1958 pioneer 2 on november 8 and pioneer 3 on december 6      pioneer 4 was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first     us spacecraft to orbit the sun in 1959 pioneer 5 was originally     designed to flyby venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to     362 million kilometers in 1960 a record until mariner 2 pioneer 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968 pioneer 6 7     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time pioneer e would     have been number 10 suffered a launch failure in 1969      pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in 1973 pioneer     11 followed it in 1974 and then went on to become the first probe to     study saturn in 1979 both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever     to do so      pioneer venus 1 1978 also known as pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer     12 burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october 8 1992 pvo made     the first radar studies of the planets surface via probe pioneer venus     2 also known as pioneer 13 sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in december of 1978 the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface though none were expected to survive to the surface the day     probe did make it and transmitted for 675 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed       ranger lunar lander and impact missions      ranger 1 and 2 were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series they     were meant for high earth orbit testing in 1961 but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed      ranger 3 launched on january 26 1962 was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit     ranger 3 did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt      ranger 4 launched april 23 1962 had the same purpose as ranger 3 but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside     the first us probe to reach the moon albeit without returning data      ranger 5 launched october 18 1962 and similar to ranger 3 and 4 lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon     and drifted off into solar orbit      ranger 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions they were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the moon ranger 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate ranger 7 through 9 performed well becoming the first     us lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965       lunar orbiter lunar surface photography      lunar orbiter 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo     missions of 19691972 the probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside     all five probes of the series launched from 1966 to 1967 were     essentially successful in their missions they were the first us     probes to orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions       surveyor lunar soft landers      the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar     module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the     soil before this time it was feared by some that the moon was covered     in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968      only surveyor 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions the rest became the     first us probes to soft land on the moon taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis apollo 12 landed 600 feet from     surveyor 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to earth surveyor 7     the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored     the tycho crater region in 1968       viking mars orbiters and landers      viking 1 was launched from cape canaveral florida on august 20 1975 on     a titan 3ecentaur d1 rocket the probe went into martian orbit on june     19 1976 and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse     planitia on july 20 1976 it soon began its programmed search for     martian microorganisms there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings one thing scientists learned was that mars sky was     pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image      the viking 1 orbiter kept functioning until august 7 1980 when it ran     out of attitudecontrol propellant the lander was switched into a     weatherreporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994 but after november 13 1982 an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders communication was never regained again despite the     engineers efforts through may of 1983      an interesting side note viking 1s lander has been designated the     thomas a mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team the national air and space museum in washington     dc is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition      viking 2 was launched on september 9 1975 and arrived in martian orbit     on august 7 1976 the lander touched down on september 3 1976 in     utopia planitia it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording     one marsquake the orbiter had a series of attitudecontrol gas leaks in     1978 which prompted it being shut down that july the lander was shut     down on april 12 1980      the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around 2025       voyager outer planet flybys      voyager 1 was launched september 5 1977 and flew past jupiter on march     5 1979 and by saturn on november 13 1980 voyager 2 was launched     august 20 1977 before voyager 1 and flew by jupiter on august 7     1979 by saturn on august 26 1981 by uranus on january 24 1986 and     by neptune on august 8 1989 voyager 2 took advantage of a rare     onceevery189years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet voyager 1 could in principle have headed towards pluto     but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up      between the two probes our knowledge of the 4 giant planets their     satellites and their rings has become immense voyager 12 discovered     that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and     aurorae three new satellites were discovered two of the major     surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous     volcanoes with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere      when the two probes reached saturn they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable the weather was tame compared with jupiter massive     jet streams with minimal variance a 33year great white spotband cycle     is known titans atmosphere was smoggy mimas appearance was     startling one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance     the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings braids     kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain      voyager 2 thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts     continued the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance one oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channels were found on     ariel and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered      in contrast to uranus neptune was found to have rather active weather     including numerous cloud features the ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring two other rings and 6 other satellites were     discovered neptunes magnetic axis was also skewed triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers whats liquid at 38k      the two voyagers are expected to last for about two more decades their     ontarget journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond pluto their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause   soviet planetary missions      since there have been so many soviet probes to the moon venus and     mars i will highlight only the primary missions       soviet lunar probes      luna 1  lunar impact

1974 went into a solar orbit 9     with its flyby bus     phobos 1  first attempt to land probes on surface of mars largest 9       moon phobos probe failed enroute in 1988 due to 9       humancomputer error     phobos 2  attempt to land probes on martian moon phobos the probe did 9       enter mars orbit in early 1989 but signals ceased one week 9       before scheduled phobos landing      while there has been talk of soviet jupiter saturn and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects more intensive studies of the moon     mars venus and various comets have been planned for the 1990s and a     mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003 how the many changes in the former soviet union now     the commonwealth of independent states will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen   japanese planetary missions      sakigake mst5 was launched from the kagoshima space center by isas on     january 8 1985 and approached halleys comet within about 7 million km     on march 11 1986 the spacecraft is carrying three instru ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic fieldplasma wavessolar wind all of     which work normally now so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on     january 8 1992 into an orbit similar to the earths the closest     approach was at 23h08m47s jstutc9h on january 8 1992 the     geocentric distance was 88997 km this is the first planetswingby for     a japanese spacecraft      during the approach sakigake observed the geotail some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence the second earthswingby     will be on june 14 1993 at 40 re earths radius and the third     october 28 1994 at 86 re       hiten a small lunar probe was launched into earth orbit on january 24     1990 the spacecraft was then known as musesa but was renamed to hiten     once in orbit the 430 lb probe looped out from earth and made its first     lunary flyby on march 19 where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite hagoromo japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the moon joining the unites states and ussr      the smaller spacecraft hagoromo remained in orbit around the moon an     apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientists     to lose track of it hagoromos rocket motor fired on schedule on march     19 but the spacecrafts tracking transmitter failed immediately the     rocket firing of hagoromo was optically confirmed using the schmidt     camera 105cm f31 at the kiso observatory in japan      hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the earths atmosphere hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 2233 jst utc9h on february 15     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moons surface 353n 97e and     fired its propulsion system for

books on particular space missions     and periodical sources on space probes this list is by no means     complete it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject if anyone can     add pertinent works to the list it would be greatly appreciated      though naturally i recommend all the books listed below i think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area i also recommend that you pick up some good uptodate     general works on astronomy and the sol system to give you some extra     background most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library some of

missions to jupiter saturn uranus and neptune      more details on american soviet european and japanese probe missions     can be found in sky and telescope astronomy science nature and     scientific american magazines time newsweek and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions     but also show you what else was going on with earth at the time events     were unfolding if that is of interest to you space missions are     affected by numerous political economic and climatic factors as you     probably know      depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go you     might also wish to join the planetary society one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration their     periodical the

154,154,subject re whos next mormons and jews from isscckbyuvmbitnet organization brigham young university lines 160   dan sorenson vikingiastateedu writes  in mcclaryc5snpqkb1netcomcom mcclarynetcomcom michael mcclary writes         just thought id clear up a few of the murky areas  actually after surviving being driven out of nauvoo and later carthage the mormons did fortify utah  they still arm themselves to defend the faith and stockpile food as well  they have been involved in quite a lot of illegal activity  including multiple and often underage wives for the leaders  a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their sect  the parallels between koresh and joseph smith are striking                                            by they you mean the leaders of the lds church  i grant you that when joseph smith was still alive plenty of accusations were filed most of which had little bearing with reality as evidenced by various verdicts i have studied lds history for 15 years now and i have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved in quote illegal activities plural marriage yes but your charge of underage wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families unlike as it appears those of david koresh          joseph smith started the sect  after he and his brother hyram were murdered in a nauvoo il jail cell church membership split over who to follow  initially smith was considered a prophet just like mohammed a rather interesting parallel considering muslims consider christ to be a prophet the same as jews im led to understand  make no mistake this was no messiah were talking about in smith  the  and neither did he claim he was  as the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders and especially those of joseph smith i have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man whose only crime was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision  many have tried to explain the smith phenomenon away but the bold presence of an 85 million member strong church stands as a witness that joseph smiths testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message  thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed down father to son  after joseph smith died his son was only entering his teens  brigham young and a few others claimed to have been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death  the council of twelve the church governing body wasnt of much help here and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects brigham young took his followers to salt lake  the rest waited for smith jr to grow up enough to assume leadership  the other claimants to the leadership were soon ignored like mike dukakis   the rest were apostates and excommunicated members of the church while the great majority of the membership the twelve and the various auxiliary organizations chose to accept brigham young as the new prophet and leader of the church  if you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine you would have known that brigham young was the first in line to fill the prophet joseph smiths vacancy he was the senior apostle in the quorum and various comments made by joseph indicated that it was brigham who would lead the latterday exodus to the west  other rightful heirs were either dead hyrum smith or excommunicated oliver cowdery and while persecutions abounded and intensified joseph smith had already given orders to look for a new place an empty land beyond the boundaries of the united states at that time  this rekhabite principle pseudographia was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful and was not questioned by them  granted a couple of doityourselfers stayed behind unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat  the church benefitted from this purification process they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world          both sects practiced the 1year food stockpile doctrine and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at least owned weapons  there is little evidence that they were a militaristic sect given that they tended to move on rather than face largescale opposition  brigham young having suffered a great deal getting to salt lake seems to have been quite justified in making military training a good thing  remember this was far beyond where even the us army went and these people had nobody to turn to save themselves          just a little context to put this all in perspective  btw since when is the church of jesus christ of latterday saints one of the largest denominations in the country a sect  it didnt splinter from any other religion as did say the southern baptists or methodists  so what did the mormons get  it seems that j edgar hoover was very impressed with the way they kept secrets  theyre pledged to defend secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood  many actually do  even to the point of suicide  what a balloney  suicide is sinful and against the law of god  i am not comfortable with this alleged cosiness with mammon i assure you that many among us reject this attitude categorically  period  our only true allegiance is to our god and to the leaders which he has appointed to represent him  in any regard to read this trash about suicide and atone for sins with blood is yet another insulting misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for           the rlds the reorganized lds are friendly rivals of the lds and delight in telling stories about them which generates quick retorts from the lds members and everybody has a grand time  at no time have i ever even heard this hinted at  im taking it with a salt block  make it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top    so he hired virtually no one but mormons until the fbi was almost exclusively staffed by members of the church of later day saints  though j edgar is finally gone the fbi personnel especially the field agents are still heavily mormon i have often wondered how this might affect the fbis treatment of religious organizations a mormon would consider heretical  preposterous  even if this were true reliable data please i am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct thats why they were selected for in the first place remember  besides one of our articles of faith strongly states the principle of freedom of religion and that all people are free to worship how where or what they may          if its true there would be little affect  lds and rlds philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true church as set down by jesus but that god will judge each on his own merits  in addition the rlds also contend and the lds may as well that ignorance of the true way tm is an excuse  you can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected it  in short lds and rlds suffer everybody from lutherans to buddhists secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they will not be penalized for ignorance  it is more likely that hoover liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade alcohol tobacco hot drink like coffee or tea and the like these people are the salt of the earth and as such are more easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them  a good explanation i can accept that  you are right that lds people are sometimes a little too cosy with mammons orders the late president kimball for example was an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the mx peace keeper missile maze in utah          thats my somewhat educated guess anyway  both sects have splinter groups that dont mirror the masses but these are small and rare and hardly worth noting their common ancestry          none of this has any relevance to guns though  when a mans religion is used to deny him the right of selfprotection with the weapons suitable for the job hell find an ally in

has come into the world but      men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds      are evil  everyone who does evil hates the light and will      not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be       exposed  kent sandvik says  it seems we are dealing with a blackandwhite interpretation brian are you subtly accusing me of evil things because i never saw the light however this is even more confusing because i even admit that i dont like the situation where im not  informed  black and white  a spade is a spade  there is no hidden agenda behind this so stop trying to look for one   it is an easy and as straight forward as it reads  kent i am not accusing you of evil things  jesus is accusing you and it is not only you that he is accusing  he is accusing everyone me you and everyone in the world is guilty  whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with  whether we do evil things  we do them regardless    jesus uses the word men  i am included  jesus is not soloing you out jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man christians are not immuned from doing evil things  a christian  is just a person in whom the holy spirit indwells  a christian  can see the evil he is doingbecause his evil has been brought out into the light  jesus is not saying that just because evil has been exposed that the christian will stop doing evil  if you havent seen jesuss light your evil deeds simply havent been exposed to the his light  you may shed some light on your own  your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela  but the holy spirit shines at a megacandela  the holy spirit can shine light into places inside us where we didnt even know existed   so do you see jesuss point  christians are not perfect  nonchristians are not perfect  nonchristians do not want to come into the light of jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives and they will not like the sight  it is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from jesuss perspective  do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are  do you think brian kendig wants to know  do you think i want to know  ego verses the truth which do you choose  im watching the news about a man who saw the light and made sure that the 19 children burned to death as part of his insight into the light i dont think the world is that simple and if  you act in such ways when you are enlighted then im a happy man and i pray i will never receive such light  and i watched koresh too an imposter who thought he saw the light  who made sure that the 19 children burned to death sadly as part of his delusion  it is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them and that ignorance was their downfall to death   and kent dont you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bringing up koreshas if koresh actually had truth in him david koresh was no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real jesus christ  david koresh who claimed to be jesus was a fraud  it was obvious  david koresh was born in america jesus was born in bethlehem  koresh wasnt even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that  jesus warned of such imposters in the endtimes  david koresh wasnt anything new to jesus  jesus told us to be aware of imposters 2000 years ago    so the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to be jesus  ask the obvious  where were you born  was your mothers name mary  if the branch davidians asked that simple question they would have labeled koresh a liar right from the start  the wouldnt have followed koresh they wouldnt have died  but look what happened  their ignorance cost them their lives  their choice to be ignorant cost them a lot  kent since you studied the bible under lutheranism do you not remember what tactic satan used to try to tempt jesus   did not satan quote the bible out of context  do you remember what tactic the serpent of genesis used to tempt eve  did he not misquote god  what satan used on eve and succeeded  was the same ploy he tried on jesus  but in jesuss case jesus rebuked satan back with the bible in context  it didnt work with jesus    does what satan did to eve in the garden and what satan tried to do with jesus in the desert remind you of what koresh did to his followers  who did koresh emulate who was koreshs teacher  koresh did to his followers what satan did to eve  did not koresh kill his followersr  did not satan cause adam and eve to die as well  did not the cult followers believe koresh even though they knew the real christ was born in bethlehem   did not eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death  god held them all responsibledeceiver and the rebeller  none  of them had an excuse    as opposed to the branch davidians we have a second chance follow jesus and he will escort us to the path of eternal life dont follow jesus and you stand condemned already for like the branch davidian complex your house is already on fire satan adam and eve have already set it ablaze   it is just a slow burn but it is burning nevertheless ,3

earth core is gravity    this paper both describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary  ether sucking structures and why we observe orbital motion    ether the theoretical propogation media of electromagnetic  waves was concluded not to exist based on the results of the  michelsonmoreley experiment conducted a century ago     i propose that those conclusions are flawed based on the fact  that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the  earths surface not perpindicular due to the prevailing assumption  that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind    the reversal of the that conclusion a pivotal keystone in the  development of modern scientific thought could have ramifications  of biblical proportions through out the world    remember einstien said imagination is greater than knowledge     1   i dream like this ether based reality     the ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality creations  start as a lattice placed into the ether given a spin the lattices both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it  converting it distilling localized mass time and energy  nonspinning lattice  dark matter    the earth isnt exactly spinning around the sun picture an image  of a galaxy we havent any videos of them spinning picture us  being stationary and the suns image being dragged across the sky by  the spinning ether field picture an onion each layer of which is  spinning a little faster than the next a thread shot at the inner  kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways its head being in a  faster shell than its tail until it finally intersected the ground  of the inner kernel its direction vector being straight down but  its foot print being a line not a point sunrise sunset      the moon isnt exactly orbiting us it is a parasite non self  spin sustaining  being dragged in the earths ether field which is  itself in the suns much more powerful field our seasons are the  wobble of earths axis like a top slowing down the orbit of the earth around the sun is all of the stars images being dragged around by the suns ether feild    the earth moon and sun are about the same size and distance  apart its just that the time between them varies greatly because  the path is not the same the moons lattice in the ether is like  sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half  turn the suns lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has  got the whole plate of noodles wound up the piece of light going to  the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at  the end the piece of light going to the sun has to go around the  whole plate like a needle in a record before it gets there     with a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon  can be about as big as earths shadow upon it and at other times  totally eclipse the sun look in the sky except for your knowledge  would you guess that they are about the same size just because they  look about the same size     o                        e     o   o   o   s  e                             m                or                m                                                  s                                      the full moon quarter moon etc is the difference between rate of ether spins what we are looking at is a rotating turntable view  of the moon only half of which is facing the sun  ive seen a  half moon within about 120 degrees of sky of the sun during the  day try and draw that earth shadow its only the moons image  which appears to orbit us no matter where it is the light part is  the part facing the sun and the dark part is the half facing away  from the sun even when it appears to be behind us    lightyears between galaxies is a misnomer the distance is  closer to zero as time and matter are characteristics of this phase  of reality which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion  defining edge  0 ether spin what we are seeing could be  essentially happening now the piece of light may have experienced  many years but the trip could be very quick our time    to time travel or warp space i might consider learning to  despin myself phase out my mass good luck trying to design  a propulsion system to drag around a spacetime locality its like  trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within    to find out about all of this i recommend studying history id  look in the book of life or holy grail etc brain waves just  might carry decipherable data id start looking on some part of the  spectra said to be unusable due to all the background noise 4  billion humans id totally isolate myself record me thinking dog  backwards and learn to read what i got microsoft holy grail card  for pentium    next concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non timebound  media the ether and that it is i who move forward in time i  would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow of time which  id start looking for as flowing

biblical guys did live hundreds of years im curios to see what  they did and ate dont worry if your hair stops growing maybe we  dont need to eat at all the cosmos are formed from nothing and  that is creating matter i only need enough to bounce around where  did the household concept immortal come from wheat is a weed it  is programmed to pull from the soil reproduce like hell and then  die    warning about writing to the past i had a little dream of being in a world in the near parallel  future lying along a path of history which we have diverged from  there were twelve telepathic glowing beings who looked like an  oscar award and who had always been a dark one who looked like us  and then myself the dark one was in the process of making the  others into gods he had to teach them what that meant by  advising them in their past basically he manipulated them into  reproducing and raising their children on his seed he said that  the little ones who looked different were a subspecies meant to  provide service he carefully combed through history rewriting it  in his favor pulling like a weed anything that compromised his  control he enticed recruits by sending them his visions saying  that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve  souls kill or be killed the amount of control he could exert was  finite though as at every change he made a void would appear in  our reality the universe one day ended 100 meters from us it  seemed odd but we couldnt remember how else it should be then  some of the twelve were no more finally when he could prune no

dan bissell  bissdasaturnwwcedu dan lawrence bissell writes  9first i want to start right out and say that im a christian  it  makes sense to be one  have any of you read tony campollos book liar  lunatic or the real thing  i might be a little off on the title but he  writes the book  anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity  in the process he became a christian himself  i assume you are posting to encourage comments  how much history has tony campello read  not much it seems   9the arguements he uses i am summing up  the book is about whether  jesus was god or not  i know many of you dont believe but listen to a  different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what  others have to say    it is good to hear that there are a few reasonable christians about if only those christian scientists would take note  in australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics  for example there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been  accounted for    9the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a  modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was  or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people  did tony follow that one up  9some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows  who would  die for a lie  wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar  people  gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing  someone who was or had been healed    millions of people have died for a lie  this  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments work in that way but consider the many aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the spanish invaders  the list is endless  the aztecs lost btw  call me a fool but i believe he did heal people    that is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me or anyone to become a christian  more to the point it does not add weight to the claim that jesus was the real thing   9niether was he a lunatic  would more than an entire nation be drawn  to someone who was crazy  very doubtful in fact rediculous  for example  anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see  this right away  have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of nazi germany  more to the point did tony mention this  one could hardly call werner heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools or  illogical men their support of hitler was based  i presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles  obviously my argument is invalid if tony thought that hitler was sane     9therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic he must have been the  real thing    hmmm i dont think his arguments warrant the use of a therefore  9some other things to note  he fulfilled loads of prophecies in  the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone  this in his betrayal  and crucifixion  i dont have my bible with me at this moment next time i  write i will use it  this is unfortunately what alot of religious discussions i have had with people result in  quoting the bible  the only reasonable way i think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present  if someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sorts of shit     tonys argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone  who thinks the bible is total fiction that jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless  for example in mathematics you cannot say a is equal to b because a is equal to b      9i dont think most people understand what a christian is    that would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct    it  is certainly not what i see a lot in churches  rather i think it  should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for gods  sake  he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  same  hey we cant do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives  over to him  thats tuff and most people dont want to do it to be a  real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at  but  just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes  time  we dont rush it in one day christianity is your whole life   it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in  a while  we box everything into time units  such as work at this  time sports tv social life  god is above these boxes and should be  carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ourselves  9    i think if you posted this part to altreligion you would get more flames than here   i have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people   someone famous said that there two evils in life polititians and churchs one rules by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead  if i am pressed i could probably find the exact quotation  cheers charles ,0

sandvik writes  my online bible is on a cd but i dont own a cdrom system for the time being so i cant search for the famous cite where jesus explicitly states that he didnt want to break existing jewish laws in other words technically speaking christians should use saturday and not sunday as their holy day if they want to conform to the teachings of jesus  i think the passage youre looking for is the following  matthew 517    think not that i have come to abolish the law and the  prophets i have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them  matthew 518   for truly i say to you till heaven and earth pass away  not an iota not a dot will pass from the law until all is accomplished  matthew 519   whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments  and teaches men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but he  who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of  heaven  matthew 520   for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of  the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven   there are several problems with this  the most serious is that the law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews but not on gentiles  there are rules that were binding on all human beings the socalled noachic laws but they are quite minimal  the issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ  the decision not to impose the law on them didnt say that the law was abolished  it simply acknowledged that fact that it didnt apply to gentiles  this is a simple answer which i think just about everyone can agree to a discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in acts 15  however theres more involved  in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grips with pauls apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law  at least as i read paul he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded  again this issue isnt one of the abolition of the law  in the middle of his discussion paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that thats not what he intends to say  rather he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness  but ultimately its an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by christ  pauls comments are not the worlds clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading  but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law  it still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for its purpose of convicting of sin its important that it not be relaxed  however for christians its not the end  ultimately we live in faith not law  while the theoretical categories they use are rather different in the end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion  the quoted passage from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesus shows us how he interprets the law  the not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading but in fact thats not jesus approach  jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial details  indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher laws  some scholars claim that mat 51720 needs to be taken in the context of 1st cent jewish discussions  jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things that really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity  mat 232325 this and the discussion later in mat 5 suggest that jesus has a very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining the law in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of it pauls conclusion is similar  while he talks about the law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath  he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards  the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being superceded and jesus talks about the law being maintained i believe they are talking about different aspects of the law  paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision  as is natural in letters responding to specific situations hes looking at the aspect of the law that is currently causing trouble the law as specifically jewish ceremonies  he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct  on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seems to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give paul so much trouble  its unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts  look at the way terms like family values take on special meaning from the current context  imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why family values should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the us  i think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was involved in  paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values that go along with the term law any more than people who concerned about the family values movement are really opposed to family values ,3

lines 133  in the april edition of one small step for a space activist allen sherzer  tim kyger write   another problem is what are called wraps or sometimes    the center tax when work for a large program like    freedom or shuttle is performed at a nasa center the    center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts    to a slush fund this money is used to fund work the    center manager wants to fund this sum is estimated to    be over a third of the funds allocated think about    that of the 30 billion cost of freedom fully 10    billion wont be spent on anything having anything    to do with space stations now maybe that 10 billion    was wisely spent and maybe it wasnt but the work done    with it should stand on its own merits not distorting    the cost of other projects congress has no idea of the    existense of these wraps congress has never heard the    term center tax they look at the station they are    getting and the price they are paying and note that    it doesnt add up they wonder this blissfully unaware    that a third of the money is going for something else  my dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here a couple of weeks ago when i first read this in your posting i talked with one of the cost experts here in space station at headquarters if you wondering why i didnt post a response immediately i do have a real job im supposed to be doing here at headquarters  digging up old 20 khz data  looking into sherzerkyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority also i spent last weekend in kansas city at the national science teachers  association conference extolling the virtues of ssf to 15000 science teachers  first off yes the concept of center tax or wrap does exist if i recall the numbers correctly the total tax for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around 40 million this was computed by adding up the wp1 wp2 and wp4 center taxes with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at 22 billion my calculater says the tax percentage is 0422  18  over the life of the ssf program using your figure of 30 billion for the cost of ssf a tax at a 18 rate comes to 540 million this is alot less than 10 billion but i will concede its still an appreciable amount of pocket change  i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 13 could be close to the actual rate the tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center kind of like mcdonalds at some states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you dont if you get it takeout for example at wp4 the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the rocketdyne contract and are not subject to the center tax i dont have the numbers in front of me but id guess at least 95 of the wp4 funds go to rocketdyne so you could be right about a tax rate of 13 but its only applied to funds spent at the center and not to the prime contracts  this leads to the obvious question what is the government doing with ssf funds that dont go to the prime contractors ie ok wp4 gets a slice of the 30 billion pie a big portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne what happens to the balance of the funds which arent eaten up by the center tax  at wp4 we call these funds we spend inhouse supporting development funds as they are supporting the development work done by rocketdyne we have used these funds to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture our testbed has a real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research a few years back with leadacid car batteries to simulate the nickelhydrogen batteries on ssf dc switchgear dcdc converter units and simulated loads data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system  we have also used the supporting development money to purchase nickel hydrogen batteries which are on life testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in indiana as a side point 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone 38 cells have completed 18552 to 23405 cycles the onorbit batteries go through 5840 cycles per year  as a final example my home division at lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations for performing system analyses like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculations using a montecarlo simulation setting up a  database with information on weight of the power system elements  finally the money raised by the tax does not all go into a slush fund at lewis the director does control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter  most of the tax however goes to fund the general services at the center like the library the  central computer services division the contractor  who removes the snow etc thus it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget doesnt go for ssf activities to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support ssf which would be hard to compute by itself  how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for 1 year is billable to ssf would you base it on the personhours ssf employees spend reading avweek versus the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare this estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library who knows maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about a burecratic nightmare  my last point is that i cant believe your claim that congress has never heard of the term center tax unfortunately all of the nasa testimony before congress isnt on a computer so i cant do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong but surely in some gao audit somewhere these nasa cost methods were documented for congress ,2

argue that your latter statement i believe that no gods exist  does rest upon faith  that is if you are making a positive statement  that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying i dont  know and therefore dont believe in them and dont not believe in then  weak atheism once again to not believe in god is different than  saying i believe that god does not exist i still maintain the   position even after reading the faqs that strong atheism requires   faith       no it in the way it is usually used in my view you are saying here   that driving a car requires faith that the car drives     im not saying this at all  it requires no faith on my part to say the car drives because ive seen it drive  ive done more than at in fact  ive actually driven it now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of whats out there but there is no evidence  pro or con  for the existence or nonexistence of god see what i have to say below on this   for me it is a conclusion and i have no more faith in it than i   have in the premises and the argument used     sorry if i remain skeptical  i dont believe its entirely a conclusion that you have seen no evidence that there is a god is correct  neither have i but lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in no way evidence for the nonexistence of something  the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation you personally have never  seen a neutrino before but they exist the pink unicorn analogy breaks down and is rather naive i have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life  evolution when i draw the conclusion that  pink unicorns dont exist because i havent seen them this conclusion has its foundation in observation and theory a pink unicorn if it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known entities that is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such god however has no such correspondence with anything imo there is no physical frame work of observation to draw any conclusions from      but first let me say the following  we might have a language problem here  in regards to faith and  existence i as a christian maintain that god does not exist  to exist means to have being in space and time god does not have  being  god is being kierkegaard once said that god does not  exist he is eternal with this said i feel its rather pointless  to debate the so called existence of god  and that is not what  im doing here i believe that god is the source and ground of  being when you say that god does not exist i also accept this  statement  but we obviously mean two different things by it however  in what follows i will use the phrase the existence of god in its  usual sense  and this is the sense that i think you are using it  i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of  god       no thats a word game   i disagree with you profoundly on this i havent defined god as existence  in fact i havent defined god but this might be getting off the subject  although if you think its relevant we can come back to it       further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is  already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are   implying more with it in which case your definition and your argument   so far are incomplete making it a fallacy     you are using wrong categories here  or perhaps you misunderstand what im saying im making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy im not trying to convince you of anything i believe  and that rests upon faith and it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm unless someone tells you that they can logically prove god or that they have evidence or  then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary  btw an incomplete argument is not a fallacy  some things are not even wrong       deletion  one can never prove that god does or does not exist when you say  that you believe god does not exist and that this is an opinion  based upon observation i will have to ask what observtions are  you refering to there are no observations  pro or con  that  are valid here in establishing a positive belief  deletion     where does that follow arent observations based on the assumption  that something exists     i dont follow you here certainly one can make observations of things that they didnt know existed i still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that god does not exist such a positive assertion requires a leap       and wouldnt you say there is a level of definition that the assumption  god is is meaningful if not i would reject that concept anyway     so where is your evidence for that god is is meaningful at some   level  once again you seem to completely misunderstand me i have no evidence that god is is meaningful at any level maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of god down your throat i however am not doing this i am arguing one and only one thing  that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap  it requires faith i am as you would say a theist however there is a form of atheism that i can respect  but it must be founded upon honesty

392,392,from timmbakemclucsbedu bake timmons subject re amusing atheists and anarchists lines 117  mccullouwhipplecswiscedu writes  my turn i went back and reread your post  all you did is attack atheism and say that agnosticism wasnt as funny as atheism  nowhere does that imply that you are agnostic or weak atheist  as most people who post such inflammatory remarks are theists it was a reasonable assumption  sorry youre right  i did not clearly state it  rule 2  condescending to the population at large ie theists will not win many people to your faith anytime soon  it only ruins your credibility  how am i being condescending to the population at large  i am stating something that happened to be true for a long time i couldnt believe that people actually believed in this god idea  it was an alien concept to me  i am not trying to win people to my faith as you put it  i have no faith  religion was a non issue when i had the attitude above because it never even occurred to me to believe  atheist by default i guess you could say  the most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude  once one has accepted the assumption that there is no gods and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumptions contradict your assumption then i would say theres a lack of consistency here  now i know youll get on me about faith  if the positive belief that god does not exist were a closed logical argument why do so many rational people have problems with that logic  but you probably like me seem to be a soft atheist  sorry for the flamage  the line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed to imply that  sorry been reading too much on the clipper project lately and the paranoia over there may have seeped in some    what is the clipper project btw  rule 4  dont mix apples with oranges  how can you say that the extermination by the mongols was worse than stalin  khan conquered people unsympathetic to his cause  that was atrocious  but stalin killed millions of his own people who loved and worshipped him and his atheist state  how can anyone be worse than that  many rulers have done similar things in the past only stalin did it when there was plenty of documentation to afix the blame on him  the evidence is that some of the early european rulers ruled with an iron fist much like stalins  you threw in numbers and i am sick of hearing about stalin as an example because the example doesnt apply  you managed to get me angry with your post because it appeared to attack all forms of atheism  it might have appeared to attack atheism in general but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons  people will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross or hammersickle  the stalin example is important not only because its still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas even after all that he had wrought  the evidence i am referring to is more a lack of evidence than negative evidence  say i claim there are no pink crows  i have never seen a pink crow but that doesnt mean it couldnt exist  but this person here claims that there are pink crows even though he admits he hasnt been able to capture one or get a photo or find one with me etc in a sense that is evidence to not believe in the existence of pink crows that is what i am saying when i look at the evidence  i look at the suppossed evidence for a deity show how it is flawed and doesnt show what theists want it to show and go on  first all the pink crowsunicornselves arguments in the world will not sway most people for they simply do not accept the analogy  why  one of the big reasons is that many many people want something beyond this life  you can pretend that they dont want this but i for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes  and there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a god can love as a truth be proven logically  themselves namely a god or gods  so in principle its hard to see how theists are necessarily arrogant  makes no sense to me  they seem arrogant to make such a claim to me but my previous refutation still stands and i believe there may be another one on the net  john the baptist boasted of jesus to many people  i find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all  many christians i know also boast in this way but i still do not necessarily see it as arrogance  of course i do know arrogant christians doctors and teachers as well  technically you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant jesus for instance  are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism  if you are talking about weak atheism which i believe in then i refuse such a claim atheism is a lack of belief  i used good ol occams razor to make the final rejection of a deity in that as i see things even if i present the hypothesises in an equal fasion i find the theist argument not plausible  i speak against strong atheism  i also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective just as say the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective  i believe i answered that  i apologize for the as you stated incorrect assumption on your theism but i saw nothing to indicate that you were an agnostic only that you were just another newbie christian on the net trying to get some cheap shots in  no apology necessary    bake timmons iii   theres nothing higher stronger more wholesome and more useful in life than some good memory  alyosha in brothers karamazov dostoevsky ,0

398,398,from mangoecsumdedu charley wingate subject re gospel dating lines 73  benedikt rosenau writes  the argument goes as follows qoid quotes appear in john but not in the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke however they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such and not an entirely different source  assuming you are presenting it accurately i dont see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion  the material in john im not sure exactly what is referred to here but ill take for granted the similarity to the mattluke q material is different hence one could have almost any relationship between the two right up to john getting it straight from jesus mouth  we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not consider their respective ages it says matthew has read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark  the version of the usual theory i have heard has matthew and luke independently relying on mark and q  one would think that if luke relied on matthew we wouldnt have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies for one thing  as it is assumed that john knew the content of lukes text the evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly  this is the part that is particularly new to me  if it were possible that you could point me to a reference id be grateful  unfortunately i havent got the info at hand  it was i think in the late 70s or early 80s and it was possibly as old as ce 200  when they are from about 200 why do they shed doubt on the order on putting john after the rest of the three  because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing copy quit a bit  the further away from the original the more copies can be written and therefore survival becomes more probable  and i dont think a one step removed source is that bad  if luke and mark and matthew learned their stories directly from diciples then i really cannot believe in the sort of big transformation from jesus to gospel that some people posit  in news reports one generally gets no better information than this  and if john is a diciple then theres nothing more to be said  that john was a disciple is not generally accepted the style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument  im not really impressed with the theology argument  but im really pointing this out as an if  and as i pointed out earlier one cannot make these arguments about i peter i see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter   one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies  the best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants which is not so bad  in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like and arguments based on mark are pretty weak  but the statement of divinity is not in that section and in any case its agreed that the most important epistles predate mark   c wingate         the peace of god it is no peace                       but strife closed in the sod mangoecsumdedu   yet brothers pray for but one thing tovemangoe           the marvlous peace of god ,0

there     fred replies translation  it doesnt support the nick szabo vision of the future to which you must subscribe  tom sez fred were all supporting what each of us thinks should be done to some degree  if you have a problem with what nick thinks should be done address it instead of just complaining about his doing so  fred again you really dont get what the complaints are about do you   not incredibly clear explanation of complaintssomething between    feelings regarding nicks method and judgments about his meaning  t maybe id get it if you said what the complaints are about rather than doing the same things that you mean to complain about  when you trash people how am i supposed to read that as trashing people is bad  f gee funny that you get it now then  deliberate obtuseness perhaps   freds issue 1  nicks alleged trashing of others   i only got it when you stopped trashing and made your point patently instead of allegorically  that was my point all along fred  not only do you do the same thing on the net honestly reporting your ideas on matters of policy and projects in space but your response was just baiting not even part of a debate  i have yet to see nick enter into anything remotely resembling a debate  i see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with the one true szabo plan i see him attacking people calling them lazy bastard because they had the temerity to disagree with the almight nick i see him questioning peoples ethics again because they had the temerity to disagree with lord god szabo  but debate  bwaaaaahhhaaaa  im glad you can laugh since your ratio of debateinsult is about the same  not even close tommy and generally only when im dealing with someone like nick  i see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate  suffice to say that i disagree with you on that last point  why dont you take a poll fred if you want some psuedoobjective pointofview  and as usual you defend your insults with he started it  yeah i took some of his research and called it my own but he started it  so what if i stole his car he stole my lawnmower first  besides that i think its still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it so your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway  your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool  i never borrowed it i already gave it back and it was broken when you gave it to me  make up yer mind fred  im not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space based process and your response doesnt tell me a thing about the reasons why you think they should be except to impune the motives of the person with a divergent opinion  who said i think they should be tommy  show me a note where i said that and ill eat this terminal    see below fred  fred i cocluded that you did since you took issue with it  the fact that my conclusion was incorrect ie that you were taking issue with something different is evidence that your communication style is confusing  or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate  first i try to address what i think you meant for which i am rewarded with a denial of sorts and a smart remark  then i point out that i am not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly interpreting you a second time and im stupid for it  i just cant win can i fred  youve got a great point here somewhere its just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it  please quote the it i took issue with  i believe you will see if you look that what i was and am taking issue with is mr szabos idea that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his toasterbased infrastructure is finished  all hail the szabo plan   fred issue 2  nicks alleged meaning   too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nicks or you would have a really good point  instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others  forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had  my reading of what nick actually said is that people arent required in all parts of all space processes so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program i read as people are required in all parts of all space processes  so help me out here fred since im so patently stupid  did you read nick wrong  or are you going to eat your terminal now  if the latter i sure hope its one of those cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about   the point is i am not stupid because of your incorrect assumption  id only be stupid if i insulted you for having made it  but alas thats your job fred  and finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points simultaneously with an allegoryinsult  sadly one point addressed a plan that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone  more deliberate lack of understanding tommy  no no i finally got it  you dont like the plan that nicks posts made you imagine  and you dont like nicks obnoxious behavior even though its no worse than your own  thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself  if you have a problem with nicks delivery address that  the way you bait youre perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of  no tommy the bait is that which elicits the response  nick baits i just flame him for being an obnoxious fool  i dont really care who started it  i read this list to get information and others views on the issues to which it was dedicated not to be your mom he started it  no he did or to hear about why nick is a very bad guy  if you think flaming is bad stop flaming or at least get to the point in the first post instead of explaining yourself all the time  thats nice tommy  when you pay me to post to the net you can complain about not getting your moneys worth  perhaps if you werent deliberately too thick to get the point the first time i wouldnt have to waste time explaining myself all the time  of course socrates  how could it be otherwise  i think its neat how all this criticism from you started after your fatherly admonitions to me about how such things should be handled outside usenet were somewhat rebuffed  being a little hypocritical tommy to go with the immaturity  or is this just the pique of a netghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he thought was new and hence could be instructed  tommy i saw you come on the net  who cares who came on the net first  if you do consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus before which i was on for about 2 years if you had seen me on the net first youd remember when nick and i went down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior  its just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior thats no worse than your own  lets see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers isnt and my complaints about your namecalling are immature while your namecalling isnt  yeah right  maybe if you called me some more names i might see it better fred  netghod wannabe  naturally fred youve correctly interpreted my motivations when yours are impossible to judge from your actions as your insulting of people that try proves  i didnt really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what i really wanted was to impress everyone  i only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail not because it belongs there but because i thought you were such a jerk that youd bring it back to the net playing right into my hands alas i had no idea what an intellectual master you were turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me  whether i should feel stupid because i tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect or becuase i tried to communicate like an adult with a selfrighteous ass still isnt clear  well fred you exposed me  now ill never be able to get another job with nasa since they all know that im stupider than fred mccall  well i just hope youre happy  please leave me alone now  i just dont have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me  maybe nick or pat can approach your high standards but im dropping it now  tommy mac  tom mcwilliams 5173552178 wk    as the radius of vision

463,463,from mcelwrecnsvaxuwecedu subject the divine masters organization university of wisconsin eau claire lines 208                                           the divine masters                              most christians would agree and correctly so that            jesus christ was a divine master and a projection of god            into the physical world god incarnate                            but there are some very important related facts that            christians are completely ignorant of as are followers of            most other world religions                             first jesus christ was not unique john 316 notwith           standing  there is always at least one such divine master            god incarnate physically alive in this world at all times            a continuous succession throughout history both before and            after the life of jesus                      the followers of some of these masters founded the            worlds major religions usually perverting the teachings of            their master in the process  christians for example added            threats of eternal damnation in hell and deleted the            teaching of reincarnation                         secondly and more importantly after a particular            master physically dies and leaves this world there is            nothing that he can do for anybody except for the relatively            few people that he initiated while he was still physically            alive  that is simply the way god set things up in the            universes                                              therefore all those christians who worship jesus and            pray to jesus and expect jesus to return and save them from            their sins are only kidding themselves and have allowed            themselves to be duped by a religion that was mostly            manufactured by the romans                        and emotional feelings are a totally deceiving            indicator for religious validity                      these things are similarly true for followers of most            other major world religions including islam                       thirdly the primary function of each master is to tune            his initiates into the audible life stream or sound            current referred to as the word in john 115 and as            the river of life in revelation 221 and to personally            guide each of them thru the upper levels of heaven while they            are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            silver cord                      true salvation which completes a souls cycles of            reincarnation in the physical and psychic planes is achieved            only by reaching at least the soul plane which is five            levels or universes above the physical universe and this            cannot be done without the help of a physicallyliving divine            master                      one such divine master alive today is an american sri            harold klemp the living eck master or mahanta for the            eckankar organization now headquartered in minneapolis            po box 27300  zip 55427                      another divine master is maharaj gurinder singh ji now            living in punjab india and is associated with the sant            mat organization

and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in india            studying under and closely observing the sant mat master of            that time maharaj sawan singh ji                      several of the eckankar books including some authored            by sri paul twitchell or sri harold klemp can be found in            most public and university libraries and some book stores or            obtained thru interlibrary loan  the book eckankarthe            key to secret worlds by sri paul twitchell is another            classic                      many christians are likely to confuse the masters with            the antichrist which is or was to be a temporary world            dictator during the socalled last days  but the masters            dont ever rule even when asked or expected to do so as            jesus was                      people who continue following christianity islam or            other orthodox religions with a physicallydead master will            continue on their cycles of reincarnation between the            psychic planes and this miserable physical world until they            finally accept initiation from a physicallyliving divine            master                                 reincarnation                           the book here and hereafter by ruth montgomery            describes several kinds of evidence supporting reincarnation            as a fact of life including hypnotic regressions to past            lives about 50 accurate the subconscious mind sometimes            makes things up especially with a bad hypnotist            spontaneous recall especially by young children some of            whom can identify their most recent previous relatives            homes possessions etc dream recall of past life experi           ences deja vu familiarity with a far off land while travel           ing there for the first time on vacation the psychic read           ings of the late edgar cayce and even supporting statements

lived            before   always use the king james version  later            versions are perversions                             strong interests innate talents strong phobias etc            typically originate from a persons past lives  for example            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having drowned at the end of a previous life             and sometimes a person will take an immediate dislike to            another person being met for the first time in this life            because of a bad encounter with him during a previous            incarnation                  the teaching of reincarnation also includes the law of            karma galatians 67 revelation 1310 etc  people would            behave much better toward each other if they knew that their            actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the            future or in a future incarnation               2nd comings                 if a divine master physically dies translates            before a particular initiate of his does then when that            initiate physically dies translates the master will meet            him on the astral level and take him directly to the soul            plane  this is the one and only correct meaning of a 2nd            coming  it is an individual experience not something that            happens for everyone all at once  people who are still            waiting for jesus 2nd coming are waiting in vain                                       planes of existence                 the physical universe is the lowest of at least a dozen            major levels of existence  above the physical plane is the            astral plane the causal plane the mental plane the etheric            plane often counted as the upper part of the mental plane            the soul plane and several higher spiritual planes  the            soul plane is the first true heaven counting upward from            the physical  the planes between but not including the            physical and soul planes are called the psychic planes                      it is likely that esp telepathy astrological            influences radionic effects biological transmutations see            the 1972 book with that title and other phenomena without            an apparent physical origin result from interactions between            the psychic planes and the physical plane                      the major planes are also subdivided  for example a            subplane of the astral plane is called hades and the            christian hell occupies a small part of it created there            less than 2000 years ago by the early catholic church by some            kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a            threatening manner  the christian heaven is located            elsewhere on the astral plane  good christians will go there            for a short while and then reincarnate back to earth                                             sound current vs blind faith                 the christian religion demands of its followers an            extraordinary amount of blind faith backed up by little more            than good feeling which is totally deceiving                         if a person is not hearing some form of the sound            current the word the bani the audible life

the benefits of the death penalty entirely disappear    thats because of your earlier claim that the one innocent death  overrides the benefit of all the others  obviously its tragic  but  it is no argument for doing away with the death penalty  if we went  to war and worried about accidentally killing civilians all of the time  because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect then  there is no way to win the war    yes  fortunately we have rightthinking folks like your good self in power  and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds of  thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oilhhhkuwait  we won the war  hurrah hurrah  the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and  exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media  the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century  this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently  the idea that hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens died is ludicrous  not even hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers died and they were the ones being targeted  or do you think that the us and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilians either the smart bombs didnt hit their targets and we know they did or they were targeting civilian targets  which is hardly condusive to destroying iraqs military potential  the military mission planners are not fools they know they have to hit military targets to win a war hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrantdictator     ok so some innocent people died  yes maybe the unarmed civilians fleeing  along that road didnt need to be bombed to bits  perhaps that kid with half  his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled legs werent  entirely guilty  but its worth the death of a few innocents to save the  oilhhhlives of the kuwaiti people isnt it  after all the iraqis may  not have had a chance to vote for saddam but they showed their acceptance of  his regime by not assassinating him right  all that surrendering and  fleeing along open roads was just a devious ploy  we were entirely within  our rights to bomb em just in case without finding out if they were  soldiers  how about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in ww2 i dont hear you bemoaning them  war is never an exact science but with smart bombs its becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties  sometimes mistakes are made targets are misidentified innocents die  thats war the way it really is but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like its one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is worse  like patrick henry said some 217 years ago i know not what course others may take  but as for me give me liberty or give me death  war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free        the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime  but the legal  shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court  battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what  it should be  hence the question is  do we instate the death penalty as  it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of  it entirely    yes lets reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be  all that shit  about fair trials and a court of appeals just gets in the way of justice   lets give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save  ourselves the expense of all those lawyers    think of the knockon benefits too  la would never have had to spend so  much money cleaning up after riots and holding showcase trials if the cops  had been allowed to do their job properly  a quick bullet through the head  of rodney king and another for the cameraman and everyone would have been  saved a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense    after all if the police decide a mans guilty that ought to be enough  the  fact that the death penalty has been shown not to have any deterrent effect  over imprisonment well thats entirely irrelevant      mathew     mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely offbase here you come off sounding like a complete peacenik idiot although i feel sure that was not your intent  so the iraqi war was wrong eh  im sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in ww2 eh  i guess we shouldnt have fought ww2 either  just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg  how about all the poor  french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent  we  should have just let hitler take over europe and youd be speaking german instead of english right now  tyrants like hussein have to be stopped  his kind dont understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun  my only regret is that bush wimped out and didnt have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi peoples sacrifice not to mention the 357 americans who died was for naught  liberating kuwait  was a good thing but wiping hussein off the map wouldve been better  and as for poor poor rodney king  did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen  when one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a stateofmind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen    law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be criminals or cops  one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of ones guilt and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict  anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism         regards  jim b ,0

474,474,from deanebinahccbrandeisedu david matthew deane subject re flaming nazis replyto deanebinahccbrandeisedu organization brandeis university lines 94  in article 1qsami3h7accessdigexnet dickeneyaccessdigexcom dick eney writes the trouble with trying to find out the truth is that roehm and his buddies were accused of being flaming faggots one of the pretexts for the night of long knives in which roehm and most of the sa wing of the nsdap were purged   stop hold it you have a few problems here official history says that  the first accusations of homosexuality in the sa came from outside of the nazi  party long before the nazis ever came to power so this objection is a red herring even if established history is wrong on this point moreover none of  the histories ive read ever made mention of hitler or anyone else ever using  homosexuality as a pretext for purging roehm a point i saw reiterated was that hitler and the party covered up these accusations if you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication you should at least get your facts right the pretext for purging roehm was that he was planning to use the sa in a coup against hitler nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge nor as a justification afterwards it is possible that the histories ive read have not mentioned this but i doubt it  would it be in hitlers best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual   anyway as i said before it is always possible that i have missed references  to the nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the sa after the  night of the long knives  but this does not prove that they were false even  the nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage in any case  this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the sa during the  1920s  since the accusers thereafter controlled the records anything bearing on the subject  true or not  has to be considered tainted evidence   ah yes i forgot this was being posted to altconspiracy i can smell the paranoia from here since the nazis never officially charged roehm with  homosexuality at least not according to what ive read id like to know  what tainted evidence you are talking about since the accusations were made  by persons outside of the nazi party long before it came to power and those  accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in germany in the  1920s and 30s just how would it be possible for the nazis to go back in  time and plant tainted evidence how exactly does one doctor newspapers  which were circulated around the world without the discrepancies being  obvious what actual incidences of nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about and what about the testimony of people who were involved in  these matters some of whom were not nazis and what is the point of making a  false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it since the point  here seems to be to discredit established history then the burden of proof  falls on the revisionist the revisionists had better do their homework  before making accusations otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts  the available data suggest that roehm and his crowd the sa  sturmabteilung storm troopers  left the world a better place when they departed   this is just about the only thing we agree on   i suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people  roehm and  his sa buddies  who were homosexuals must disturb some people the feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals this fear  often justified  is what lies behind this distrust of official history or so it seems to me but this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject if  you really think that historians are so incompetent why dont you write them  and ask where they got their sources on this subject if you cant tell from  their footnotes im a graduate student in history writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat but my time is limited and this is not my specialty  and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence im not going to waste my time trying to debunk someones paranoia do the research yourself  but concrete particulars are still no more than more or less shrewd guesses    diccon frankborn  given that you already consider all evidence tainted what on earth would constitute concrete particulars and since when have concrete particulars been considered shrewd guesses  i suggest that those who do not trust popular historians irving et al  historians writing for a popular audience do not as a rule provide copious  footnotes  should try instead reading academic historians who usually  provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail this is the place  to start looking assuming that one really wants to know the truth  ill bet the folks on altpagan are tired of this subject already my apologies  we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent i forget which gods are responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject boundaries                                                                          david matthew deane

1993   introduction   in order to increase public interest in spacebased and lunar operations a real miniature lunarlike environment is being constructed on which to test teleoperated models these models are remotelycontrolled by individuals located worldwide using their personal computers for edutainment purposes not only does this provide a testbed for simple teleoperation and telepresence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space including but not limited to layout of a lunar colony teleoperating machines for work and play disseminating educational information providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in twentyfirst century remote learning methods   because of the nature of the ltm1 project people of all ages interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals models and structures interfacing and electronics software and graphics in operation ltm1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children students and professionals worldwide using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to teleoperate real models at the ltm1 base for experimental or recreational purposes because a real facility exists ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves   this has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups   teleoperations and virtual reality research   radio control model railroad and ham radio operation   astronomy and space planetariums and science centers   art and theater   bbs and online network users   software and game developers   manufacturers and retailers of model rockets cars and trains   children   the child in all of us   ltm1 overall design   a room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout the walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains star fields and a view of the earth the floor is the simulated lunar surface a global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements scenery and machinelets    the ltm1 initial design has 3 teleoperated machinelets  1 an ssto scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land  2 a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area and  3 a moontrain which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface    each machinelet has a small tv camera utilizing a ccd tv chip mounted on  it a personal computer digitizes the image including reducing picture  content and doing datacompression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes and also return control signals   the first machinelet to be set up will be the moontrain since model trains with tv cameras built in are almost offtheshelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal the user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to ltm1   next an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspended from a servomotor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the ssto to be controlled by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and land   finally some tank models will be modified to be ccd tv chip equipped bulldozerlets the entire initial ltm1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff traveling and doing work the entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardwaresoftware developers   by taking a graphically oriented communications program dmodem and adding a teleoperations screen and controls the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours   plan of action   the diaspar virtual reality network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and internet access to that network diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model diaspar has in stock the electronic tanks that can be modified and one ccd tv chip diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock for the lunar train model diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machineslets an initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photosession and news conference on april 30 1993 the initial models will be put in place a timelapse record will be started for historical purposes it is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn the lunar colony will be declared open for additional building operations and experiments a photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to gif images for distribution worldwide to major online networks and bbss a press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas time talent materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony   a contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced universities will be invited to participate the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model field trips to ltm1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model contributors will then be able to teleoperate any contributed machinelets once they return to their campus   a monthly ltm1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media any major new teleoperated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media having a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community especially since the action will be controlled by people all over the world science fiction writers will be invited to issue challenges to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the teleoperated equipment to perform lunar tasks using counterweight and pulley systems 16 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges   the long term goal is creating worldwide interest education experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony ltm1 has the potential of being a long term global edutainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space edutainment all of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars   conclusion   edutainment is the blending of education and entertainment anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purposes by creating a teleoperated model lunar colony we not only create worldwide publicity but also a method of trying new ideas that require real not virtual skills and open a new

true i see every single line item on a contract and i have to sign it there is no such thing as wrap at this university    dennis i have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of  customers included government including nasa for profit and nonprofit companies all expected a wrap usually called a fee much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors the subcontractors where universities forprofits nonprofits and even some of the nasa centers for the commercialization of space all charged fees as part of the work down the street is one of the nasa commercialization centers they charge a fee    you totally forgot the original post that you posted allen in that post you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any overhead geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true  now im sure your a competent engineer dennis but you clearly lack experience in several areas your posts show that you dont understand the importance of integration in large projects you also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything this isnt a flame jsut a statement  come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration this is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it    your employer does charge a fee you may not see it but you do   of course there is a fee it is for administration geez allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate costs such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally stated ityou stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true which is it allen  sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate go ask your costing people how much fee they add to a project   i did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this is included in the overhead   well there you are dennis as i said they simply include the fee in their overhead many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer   as you have posted on this subject allen you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge you admit here that this is wrong nasa has a line item budget every year i have seen it allen get some numbers from that detailed nasa budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it until you do that you are barking in the wind  no allen you did not you merely repeated allegations made by an employee of the overhead capital of nasa    integration dennis isnt overhead   nothing that reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the other nasa centers  where the work is going on   integration could be done better at the centers apollo integration was  done here at msfc and that did not turn out so bad the philosophy of reston is totally wrong allen there you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee there is no way that will ever work it has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on could you imagine a reston like set up for  apollo  dennis reston has been the only nasa agency working to reduce costs when wp 02 was hemoraging out a billion  the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station   oh you are full of it allen on this one i agree that jsc screwed up big they should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced to make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes come to msfc for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it   kinda funny isnt it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is overhead   when you have a bit more experience dennis you will realize that integration isnt overhead it is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort   i agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful large scale effort what i completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work it is called leadership allen that is what made apollo work final responsibility for the success of apollo was held by less than 50 people that is leadership and responsibility there is neither when you have any organization set up as reston is you could take the same people and move them to jsc or msfc and they could do a much better job why did it take a year for reston to finally say something about the problem if they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place  there is one heck of a lot i do not know allen but one thing i do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership i remember all of the turn over at reston that kept ssf program in shambles for years do you it is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem lack of leadership from the white house congress and at reston nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem you are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this  why did the space news artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems methinks that you are being  selective with the facts again   the story you refer to said that some nasa people blamed it on congress suprise suprise the fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldnt address the problems until the press published the story   are you saying the reston managers where wrong to get nasa to address the overruns you approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns   no i am saying that if they were located at jsc it never would have  happened in the first place  if it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year you stated that your friend at reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap were gone this merely points out a  blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see   you should know dennis that nasa doesnt include transport costs for resuply that comes from the shuttle budget what they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport   sorry gang but i have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going to have to do allens math for him for a while i will have little chance to do so   i do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of reston to ask that the problems with wp 02 be addressed   i have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at jsc the problem never would have happened totally ignoring the lack of leadership of congress this many headed hydra that has grown up at nasa is the true problem of the agency and to try to  change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of your position  dennis university of alabama in huntsville  ,2

what happened to the saturn v plans      despite a widespread belief to the contrary the saturn v blueprints     have not been lost they are kept at marshall space flight center on     microfilm      the problem in recreating the saturn v is not finding the drawings it     is finding vendors who can supply mid1960s vintage hardware like     guidance system components and the fact that the launch pads and vab     have been converted to space shuttle use so you have no place to launch     from      by the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and remodify     the launch pads you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design       why data from space missions isnt immediately available      investigators associated with nasa missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     scooped by people uninvolved in the mission

discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the galileo and ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous numerous studies claim that even in     worstcase scenarios shuttle explosion during launch or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities the risks are extremely small     two interesting data points are 1 the may 1968 loss of two snap 19b2     rtgs which landed intact in the pacific ocean after a nimbus b weather     satellite failed to reach orbit the fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium 2 in april 1970 the apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its snap 27 rtg heat source which     was jettisoned fell intact into the 20000 feet deep tonga trench in     the pacific ocean the corrosion resistant materials of the rtg are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     halflives of the pu238 fuel or about 870 years doe 1980      to make

srbs are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources the     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study charles jackman      the atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was     organized by dr michael prather nasagoddard institute for space     studies  the three groups involved michael prather and maria garcia     nasagiss charlie jackman and anne douglass nasagoddard space     flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and     environmental research inc  the effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere      the following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine         industrial sources    300000000 kilogramsyear 9  natural sources     75000000 kilogramsyear 9  shuttle sources9  725000 kilogramsyear      the shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 titan rockets are     launched yearly thus the launches would add less than 025 to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources      the effect on ozone is minimal  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 00065 this is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares      the influence of humanmade chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1 decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990 the influence of the space shuttle and     titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible  the launch     schedule of the space shuttle and titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time

     the challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion this is     a welldocumented fact see the rogers commission report for example     what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the kerwin     teams medicalforensic report      the astronauts were killed when the moreorless intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200mph and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater their remains were recovered and after the kerwin team     examined them they were sent off to be buried       using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit      you cant use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit     because it cant get there it is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks      furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of     that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between earths surface and low orbit taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized highorbit     spacecraft      yet another

writer richard hoagland has championed the idea that the face is     artificial intended to resemble a human and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental other viking images show a     smileyfaced crater and a lava flow resembling kermit the frog elsewhere     on mars there exists a mars anomalies research society sorry dont     know the address to study the face      the mars observer mission will carry an extremely highresolution     camera and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years in the meantime speculation about the face is     best carried on in the altnet group altalienvisitors not scispace or     sciastro      v dipeitro and g molenaar unusual

your favorite acronym please let me know  also if theres an acronym not on this list that confuses you drop me a line and if i can figure it out ill add it to the list  note that this is intended to be a reference for frequently seen acronyms and is most emphatically not encyclopedic  if i incorporated every acronym i ever saw id soon run out of disk space    the list will be posted at regular intervals every 30 days  all comments regarding it are welcome im reachable as bradfrd2ncarucaredu  note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for  youre on your own for figuring out what they mean  note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what i can list specialpurpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as theyre introduced are omitted further some acronyms stand for more than one thing as of edition 3 of the list these acronyms appear on multiple lines unless theyre simply different ways of referring to the same thing  thanks to everybody whos sent suggestions since the first version of the list and especially to garrett a wollman wollmangriffinuvmedu who is maintaining an independent list somewhat more verbose in character than mine and to daniel fischer dfispecklecmpifrbonnmpgde who is maintaining a truly huge list 535 at last count of acronyms and terms mostly in german which i read fortunately  special thanks this time to ken hollis

555,555,from mogaldeadheadasdsgicom joshua mogal subject re sgi sales practices was crimson was kubota announcement organization silicon graphics inc lines 123 nntppostinghost deadheadasdsgicom   my  comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other  vendors  that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi  opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive 3d graphics applications it is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor  sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable     what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that  we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the  crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck  if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team feel free to contact the local branch managerwe understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot     im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a  previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around  for a while rather than being flushed  as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4d20 4d25 4d30 and 4d35 as clock rates sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about 45 years this was true of the motorolabased 3000 series 8589 the pi 8893 the professional series the early 4ds  8690 the power series parallel systems 8893 individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years new graphics architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every 18 months to 2 years  these are the facts of life  if we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and io and larger disk capacities if we dont we become uncompetitive  from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today  you cant wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep for one in writing if its feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the performance protection program for older r3000based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r4400based 64bit multiprocessor systems     now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to  keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself  pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books  just before the end of the quarter but im just a little tired of  getting boned in the process    if thats happening its becausing of misunderstandings or miscommunication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base   maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we  arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa  for instance are  this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs  and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers  every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis  most sgi customers are onesytwosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we preannounced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments   the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the  entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that  means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i  have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one  previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other  vendor  im going to be looking at this box for the next five years  and every time i look at it im going to think about sgi and how i  could have better spent my money actually your money since were  supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars    five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor technologies are arriving every 12 years making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor  there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so dont give up we know it  josh          9999     99999 9joshua mogal99     9product manager999 9advanced graphics division   9  advanced graphics

article 8feuko00xsf0kpc5pandrewcmuedu david o hunt bluelobstercmuedu writes  im pretty sure ive seen biblical rules for when its allowable to rape  prisoners what the codes are about that etc  could some more  knowledgable soul than i please let me know some references  he asked a very narrow question and i gave a very narrow answer    yes sorry i have got that wrong my apology     deletion   no david hunts post didnt mention a god nor did my response you were the first to bring up the idea of the bible being given by god  most jews dont believe this in any literal sense    so no fun but i must have met the minority then and given by god refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something     rob i am not intimate with jewish theology but i understand that you are a messianic jew correct me if i am wrong but it appears that the views of messianic jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of jews while jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the christianic god views i have heard that it is possible for jews to attribute evil to their god an nono for christians the bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man     deletion no  i thought we agreed that though jews disagree there are a set of core beliefs that they do agree upon one of which is that the commandments are accessible and written in the language of the time and another of which is that there must be a legal system to update them    the context was metaphysics even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion i wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system     deletion could you explain this with respect to the original commandments being discussed  that is the commandment that says if you feel like raping a woman prisoner you should instead wait and marry her  what about the way this commandment is given invalidates it    is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds the context is repulsive and it is foul play imo to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book     big deletion   the point is that i see that there is a necessary connection  between the theology you use and the interpretation of the bible   only very loosely  my interpretation of the bible is based on a long tradition of jewish scholars interpreting the bible  theology doesnt really enter into it  there are jewish atheists who interpret the laws of charity essentially the same way i do    no not the interpretation of some laws but the interpretation of the bible as in the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue with god the whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god whatever that means that alone is a theo logic question is proof of a theology used      you pose another metaphysical riddle   no you do   well you wrote this  fine so we have some major spirit with neither absolute power  nor absolute knowledge and as it appears limited means or will  to communicate with us some form of spiritual big friend  do you admit that using god in this context is somewhat unusual   am i right in the assumption that it cannot have created the  universe as well and that the passages in the bible referring  to that or its omnipotence are crap  thats what i meant by the riddle    it is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh sodom and gomorrha means either there is some connection between the text the fact that it exists and your interpretation of it or it is purely arbitrary further the question is why is has one to carry the burden of biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better you might answer that one cant becuase  some peculiar biblical information might be lost but that holds true of every other book and the question remains why has the bible still a special place cant it be replaced somehow is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the bible against some other message that is included as well     deletion  do you see the danger in doing so especially with the metaphers used  in the bible  i think the danger of doing so is less than either the danger of having a frozen system of laws or having no laws    sorry but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system   deletion if we read two stories about the importance of helping the poor and in one god is a spirit and in the other god has a body which is more important helping the poor or resolving the contradiction about the corporeal nature of god    if we read two stories in the bible one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly what is more important to resolve the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god     and the argument you have given is a fallacy while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not it can be crucial in other questions religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god   one cannot resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what is good depends on the question    benedikt ,0

17462bd37a66paranetfidonetorg  billcarlsonp0f18n104z1fidonetorg bill carlson writes  since everywhere i look zoroaster is suggested as being a probable  descendant of daniel suppose you prove he wasnt  ref encyclopedia of religion mircea eliade  magi   sneak preview later still eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting  ground for iranian and judeochristian religions as can be seen in the famous  oracles of hystaspes a work whose iranian roots are undeniable and which  most likely dates from the beginning of the christian era probably the  second century ce widengren 1968 the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of  the future saoshyant was the basis for the story of the coming of the magi  to bethlehem in the gospel of matthew 2112    the old persian word magu rendered in greek by magos is of uncertain  etymology it may originally have meant member of the tribe as in the avestan compound mogutbish hostile to a member of the tribe this meaning would have been further resticted among the medes to member of the priestly tribe and perhaps to priest benveniste 1938 boyce 1982 the term is probably of median origin given that herodotus mentions the magoi as one of the six tribes of the medes   for a variety of reasons we can consider the magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of median origin in western iran among the persians they were responsible for liturgical functions as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult most likely the supremacy of the median priesthood in western iran became established during the time of the median monarchy that dominated the persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century bce until the revolt of cyrus the great 550 bce the persians were indebted to the medes for their political and civil institutions as well even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period boyce 1982 we must still maintain that they were of median origin this is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of gaumata the magian mentioned by darius i 522486 bce in the inscription at bisutun iran as well as by greek sources indeed herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the medes against the persians through the conspiracy of the magi   the fact that the magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions this seems to be attested by the elamite tablets at persepolis   there is a theses put forth by giuseppe messina that denies that the magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood  a priesthood of purely zoroastrian origin this thesis is untenable on the other hand the hypothesis that their name is related to the avestan term magavan derived from the gathic maga vedic magha gift is not without foundation mole 1963 the meaning of maga can probably be found in conformity with the pahlavi tradition within the context of the concept of purity or separation of the mixture of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter the maga which has been erroneously interpreted as chorus from the root mangh which is said to mean sing the magic song nyberg 1966 and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision in any case though there may be a relation between the old persian term magu and the avestan terms magavan and maga we must maintain a clear distinction between the magi and the avestan priesthood the avesta ignores the median or old persian term despite a recent hypothesis proposed by hw bailey old persian inscriptions ignore the avestan term for priest athravan vedic athravan even if this is  perhaps present in an achaeminid setting in the elamite tablets of persepolis  gershevitch 1964   the term magu has been present in zoroastrianism throughout its history the pahlavi terms moghmard and mobad represent its continuation the latter in particular derives from an older form magupati head of the magi during the sasanid period third to seventh centuries ce which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church the title mobadan mobad the high priest of high priests came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy   the magi practiced consanguineous marriage or khvaetvadatha av pahl khwedodah they also performed a characteristic funeral rite the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it the corpse was not supposed to decompose lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction this practice later became typical of the entire zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in iran and among the parsis in india stone towers known as dakhmas were built especially for this rite during the time of herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the magi the persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax then buried it the practice was widespread however among the peoples of central asia   the magi were the technicians of and experts on worship it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a magus during the performance of a ritual sacrifice the magus sang of the theogony the magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the avesta and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future the magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful or ahrimanical animals khrafstra such as snakes and ants they dressed in the median style wearing pants tunics and coats with sleeves they wore a characteristic head covering of felt gr tiara with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath boyce 1982 the color of these caps in conformity with a tradition that is probably of indoeuropean origin according to georges dumezil was that of the priesthood white   in all likelihood during the achaemenid period the magi were not in possession of a welldefined body of doctrine and it is probable that they gradually adopted zoroastrianism they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism nonetheless they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of zorastrian traditions by virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes the wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the magic of zarathushtra son of horomazes and thus the cult of the gods magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just courageous and master of himself   during the achaemenid period the magi maintained a position of great influence although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of gaumata the magian  in which according to herodotus who calls himself smerdis the persians killed a large number of magi to avenge the usurpation  the magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in media in persia and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the persian civilian and military administration   no priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the magi they were renowned as followers of zarathushtra zoroaster as the teachers of some of the greatest greek thinkers pythagoras democritus plato as the wise men who arrived guided by a star at the manger of the newborn savior in bethlehem and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in india but they were also known as the chaldeans the priesthood of babylon known for its occultism this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in greek like goes expert in the magic arts bidez and cumont 1938 indeed the chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts especially astrology and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge   to understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views it is necessary to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the socalled western magi who were later hellenized in the achaemenid period both must have been at least in part zoroastrian but the western magi those of the iranian diaspora in asia minor syria mesopotamia and armenia who came in contact with diverse religious traditions must have sooner or later and in varying degrees been influenced by syncretic concepts   the greeks were familiar with both kinds of magi and depending on their varying concerns would emphasize one or the other aspect of them classical historians and geographers including herodotus and strabo document their customs while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines dualism belief in the hereafter magian cosmology and cosmogony and their theology and eschatology those sources most interested in the doctrines of the magi even speak of zarathushtra as a magus in doing so they are repeating what the magi themselves said from the median and achaemenid periods when they adopted zoroastrianism at that time they embraced zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name   zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die it has been said quite often in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the magi in the zoroastrian tradition that the vendidad from vidaevodata the lawabjuring daivas part of the avesta should be attributed to them this collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices nonetheless the hypothesis is hardly plausible since the first chapter of the vendidad  a list of sixteen lands created by ahura mazda the supreme god of zoroastrianism but contaminated by an attack by ahriman pahl gathicavestan angra mainyu the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering  does not mention western iran persia or media the land of ragha mentioned in the text cannot be median raghiana furthermore it has been noted gershevitch 1964 that if the authors had been magi the absence of any reference to western iranian institutions including their own priesthood would be very strange   the magi were above all the means by which the zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the avesta have been transmitted to us from the second half of the first millennium bce on this has been their principal merit we can attribute directly to the magi the new formulation that iranian dualism assumed known to us especially from greek sources and in part from the pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries ce according to this formulation the two poles of the dualism are no longer as in the gathas spenta mainyu beneficent spirit and angra mainyu hostile spirit but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu gershevitch 1964 see ahura mazda and angra mainyu this trans formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of zoro astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religious world in this new dualism  which was that later known to the greeks aristotle eudemus of rhodes theopompus and others  we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within zoroastrianism to which we give the name zurvanism see zurvanism   thanks to their adherence to zoroastrianism the magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of zarathushtras treachings as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the iranian diaspora the greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them xanthus of lydia hermodorus aristotle theopompus hermippus dinon even writing treatises on the persian religion of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived in the hellenistic period the magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom and writings on magic astrology and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as zarathushtra ostanes and hystaspes forming an abundant apocryphal literature bidez and cumont 1938   later still eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeochristian religions as can be seen in the famous oracles of hystaspes a work whose iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the christian era probably the second century ce widengren 1968 the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant was the basis for the story of the coming of the magi to bethlehem in the gospel of matthew 2112 see saoshyant   the sasanid period saw the magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of iran concerned to win back the western magi de menasce 1956 and eager to consolidate zoroastrianism as the national religion of iran the priests of iranian sanctuaries in media and persia were able to establish a true state church strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures the leading figures in the development of a state religion and of zoroastrian orthodoxy were tosar and kerder the persecutors of mani in the third century  saoshyant   the avestan term saoshyant future benefactor mpers soshans designates the savior of the world who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind the concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of zoro astrianism together with that of dualism it appears as early as in the gathas zarathushtra zoroaster as the prophet of the religion is himself a sao shyant one who performs his works for the frashokereti the end of the present state of the world when existence will be rehabilitated and made splendid see frashokereti   later zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological myth and expanded the number of saoshyants from one to three all the saviors are born from the seed of zarathushtra which is preserved through the ages in lake kansaoya identified with presentday lake helmand in seistan iran protected by 99999 fravashis or guardian spirits the greatest of the awaited saoshyants the victorious astvatereta he who embodies truth the son of the vispataurvairi she who conquers all is the third who will make existence splendid he appears in yashts 19 upon his arrival humankind will no longer be subject to old age death or corruption and will be granted unlimited power at that time the dead will be resurrected and the living will be immortal and indestructable brandishing the weapon with which he kills the powerful enemies of the world of truth that is the world of the spirit and of asha astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and render it imperishable he and his comrades will engage in a great battle with the forces of evil which will be destroyed   the name astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation kellens 1974 as are those of his two brothers ukhshyatereta he who makes truth grow and ukhshyatnemah he who makes reverence grow the names of the three virgins yashts 13 who are impregnated with the seed of zarathushtra when they bathe in lake kansaoya and give birth to the saoshyants are equally speculative each of these saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a millennium initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind   the doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the archaemenid period sixth to fourth century bce it was not perhaps the principal element in the formation of the messianic idea but it was certainly a determining factor one that enjoyed great success in the hellenistic period beyond the confines of the iranian world a similar concept that of the future buddha maitreya was most likely indebted to it and christian messianism can trace its roots to the same source ,3

dzkrizocfberkeleyedu dennis kriz writes  hi all    im going to try to do something here that perhaps many would  not have thought even possible  i want to begin the process of  initiating a literary critical study of the pornography posted on  altsexstories to identify the major themes and motifs present  in the stories posted there  opening up then the possibility of  an objective moral evaluation of the material present there    first off let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about you sick perverts you are immoral you are all going to hell which seems to be the usual religious post found on the altsex hierarchy  hopefully you wont get flamed either  you will however be argued with  i personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground  first i do not believe that there is any way to find an objective morality  morality and value are inherently subjective  they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people  they can be widely held perhaps even overwhelmingly held but they are never and can never be objective   assumptions    1 a christian bedrock assumption that all that is true comes  truly from god     2 regarding altsexstories  while perhaps even from an  objective standpoint the majority of its material is indeed  repugnant you come to this conclusion quite quickly when you  start thinking about analyzing its material like this some of  it reflects some fairly profound needs in people as well as some  truths  and deserve to be pointed out  second i do not accept the assumptions that you make here  if as you say you are trying to be objective then why accept a morality to begin with by using the christian bible  youre defeating your own purpose by doing so    in the long run the advantage of making such a literarymoral  analysis is that it will save bandwidth between christians and  non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of  the stuff on these pornographic groups  third call me a pessimist but you wont stop the flamage  there will always be people who pop upin altsex to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are  just out of curiosity do altsex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrowminded censoring overbearing totalitarianists    basically there should not be a dissonance between a christian  morality and a nonchristian one  either there is value in a  particular work or there is not whether one is a christian or  not  hm  let me provide an example  four people get together over dinner to discuss morality you me a rather conservative moslem and a sociopath  i start off by saying that i think its immoral to force people to have sex with you  you agree but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender  just a note i really dont know your views on homosexuality i am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example  the moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered  the sociopath who has become bored kills all three of us and eats us but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind                                                                             in support for the first assumption    the christian scriptures say this  9evidence deleted  im not going to accept your evidence for this  you ask us to accept the word of god that everything good comes from god  this is only a valid argument for a person who shares your beliefs  still i must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could be interesting for other reasons than yours so good luck with this next part                                                                                             now then what are some of the major themesmotifs in the  pornographic literature on places like altsexstories  these  are some that ive been able to identify  please addcomment on  them      motif 1  the malecinderella      in so many of the stories there is expressed a feeling of  alienation and worthlessness on the part of the writer or  otherwise protagonist of the story with regard to the object the  other person of hisher desire often a story involves a  protagonist who on the surface is quite average but underneath  usually has an enormous dick who desires to in some way to gain  access in a definitely sexual way to the other person who  heshe confesses is far more desireable than heshe is and who  indeed seems to walk between the raindrops     hmmmdo i detect just a wee bit of condescence here                                                           motif 2  a celebration of indeed preoccupation with beauty                                  9999not very objective    the vast majority of pornographic literature deals with beauty  be it innocence somehow about to be lost grace or simply  physical beauty  and generally most people christian or non  will say that beauty is good   one could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better or more good than nonbeautiful people  i would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily true                          motif 3  ones dick is ones instrument of redemption                              might i suggest the word penis it seems more in line with the tone of your post                   blessed are those who are wellhung for they shall get       laid  from what would thus be a revised matthew 5     bravo  i respect you and your sense of humor sir      motif 4  sex as an expression of sincere giving                                                       there is often enough a clear desire on the part of the  protagonist to give definitely sexual pleasure to the object  person of hisher desires                                                   yes and this theme is usually what the better stories are about  however they are not always selfish  i could point to examples in the work of elf sternberg for example     motif 5  altsexstories describes a sex which is completely  removed from the realm of transmitting life      so removed is sex from its procreative dimension on  altsexstories that one begins to wonder why sex even involves  ejaculation as in the context described in pornography it serves  then no real purpose    it serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies it affirms the virility of the male involved as well as assuring the reader that he the character has orgasmed                         the whole picture tm is probably very well described by the  catholic teaching on this of the husband and wife in an act of  total mutual selfgiving in the sexual union cooperating with  god in opening themselves up for the transmission of new life  cf humane vitae    your whole picture tm unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church           in addition if sex is for procreation then  19why did god make it pleasurable so that people would want to do it rather than building it in as instinct 29why did god make it fallible  not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy even among catholics  does this mean that they have sinned    in any case altsexstories and the catholic teaching will  probably not see eye to eye on this for a long time   granted     motif 6  sex used as an instrument violence power and  humiliation                                        why pornography seems to tend in that direction i really do not  know  probably volumes could be written on the relationships  between sex and powerhumiliation  but this probably gives good  reason why traditionally judeochristianity has been so negative  with regard to sexuality  it seems to tend to a great moral  morass   pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it  many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life but will think about and read about and mull over  later 999999jeff

they do not want to know it or be exposed to light  because their own evil deeds will be uncovered  and so by their own choice they will remain in darkness  sort of like bugs under a rock  however some people but not many will not like the darkness  sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable  these people will crawl out from under the rock and although blinded at first will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warm  and after a while by virtue of the light they will see the depths of their own shortcomings and how to correct them  and also they will see that there is much much more to this world than just the narrow little experiences under the rock  they will  discover that life under a rock was incredibly yukky and that life with the light of the world is great  so great that they will want to tell all their friends about it  and i maintain  some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters because they fear it they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own terms  and so by their own choice they will remain in darkness sort of like bugs under a rock  however some people but not many will not like the darkness  sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable these people will crawl out from under the rock and although blinded at first will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth  and after a while now that they can see things for what they really are they will also see the heights which they can reach and the places they can go and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes  they will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the rock  they will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky and that life on their own terms is great  so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it  do you see my point  i think youre the one under the rock and im getting a great tan out here in the sunlight  my life has improved immesurably since i abandoned theism  come and join me  it will be a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the long hike but its well worth it  not all people hate light kent we all have an adversion to it to some extent  but brian kendig who has been replying to this thread certainly likes darkness  brian k enjoys stating false concepts and false pressumptions about the god of the bible  without checking his own presumptions he compares my god with odin or zeus  look you just practically equated odin and zeus  theyre as much different as your god is from them  dont you see  im not going to accept anything that i cant witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not something as megapowerful as what youre trying to get me to accept surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good reason to dont you  withough checking his own presumption he thinks hell is the equivalent of nonexistence  when did i say that  i say that i would rather cease existing instead of being subject to the whims of a deity but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who i am then so be it  do you enjoy darkness  most people will honestly admit yes  most people are fond of their sexual sins their hording of money their selfishness and not to mention their biblical ignorance  nope  most people are christian  most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect of believing that the world is an undesirable place of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again of doing just as their priests tell them like good little sheep  you enjoy darkness and youre proud of it  you may know the bible well  but have you read any of the koran  or zen writings  or hare krishna literature  if you havent then how can you say you have an open mind  sin is fun  lets admit it  but a life of sin leads to trouble and death in this life and hell in the next  nope  you make decisions enjoy your successes and accept your failures then you die  if you are content with the life youve led as you reflect back on it in your final moments then youve led a good life  come out from under the rock    please do      for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son     that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal     life  im sorry i dont feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god id worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case its not really all that important  forget the bible for a minute  forget quoting verses forget about who said what about this or that  show me  picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop and convince me that youre right      brian kendig                             je ne suis fait comme aucun   bskendignetcomcom                de ceux que jai vus jose croire

nntppostinghost cpuserveracsccom  hi everyone  i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups  announcing the release of multiverse102  multiverse is a multiuser nonimmersive xwindows based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainmentresearch  features     clientserver based model using berkeley sockets    no limit to the number of users apart from performance    generic clients    customizable servers    hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources    multiple light sources ambient point and spot    objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily         attached  functionality    client    the client is built around a fast render loop basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the users    viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the users    actions  which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users     the client is designed to be generic  in other words you dont need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it the adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers     this release of the client software supports the following functionality      o hierarchical objects with associated addressing      o multiple light sources and types ambient point and spot      o user interface panels      o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for 9faster frame rates      o mouse and keyboard input     some people may be disappointed that this software doesnt support the    powerglove as an input device  this is not because it cant but because    i dont have one this will however be one of the first enhancements    servers    this is where customization can take place the following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers      o transparent client management      o client message handling     this may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them  the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally     things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects      o server selectable extension installation         what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world basically you call the extension         initialisers you want      o event handler registration         when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to         current events supported init move change collide  terminate      o collision detection registration         if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software         your callback will be activated when a collision occurs      this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose      the following is all you need to make a world server application      o provide an initworld function         this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus         any initialization you want to do      o provide a positionobject function         this is where you determine where to place a new client      o provide an installworldobjects function         this is where you load the world wld file for a new client      o provide a getworldtype function         this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have      o provide an animateworld function         this is where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the objects         move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit         to avoid outrunning the clients      thats all there is to it and to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers ive provided          generic  81 lines         dactyl  270 lines more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs will probably be improved with future                            versions         dogfight  72 lines  location     this software is located at the following site    ftpuwashingtonedu     directory    pubvirtualworlds     file    multiverse102tarz  futures     client      o texture mapping      o more realistic rendering ie zbuffering or similar gouraud shading      o hmd support      o etc etc     server      o physical modelling gravity friction etc      o enhanced object managementinteraction      o etc etc     both      o improved comms  i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and im not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified   i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe  ive certainly found fascinating developing it and i would love to add support for the powergloveand an hmd   finally one major disclaimer  this is totally amateur code by that i mean there is no support for this code other than what i out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide i cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code  use it at your own risk  disclaimer over  of course if you love it i would like to here from you and anyone with positive contributionscriticisms is also encouraged to contact me anyone who hates it  devnull    and if anyone wants to let me do this for a

in article c554f53gfpanixcom mlspanixcom michael siemon writes   the issue then is this  9christian a says behavior suchandsuch is sinful  what is 9christian b supposed to do with such a statement   one possibility always exists  a may be able to persuade b that the  behavior in question does exhibit a failure in loving god or neighbor  michael modern liberal that he is reads a fairly benign meaning into this word  he then constructs his religious beliefs around this understanding reading other scripture in the context of  these commandments with love benignly understood  i regard love as no more or less benign than any other christian does you are merely expressing approval of the consequences i find therein which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my or any religion  love is a highly ambiguous word of which christians can write both the gentle words paul uses of it in 1 corinthians  in a passage that even the conservatives will quote at you   and the words of t s eliot in his pentacost hymn love is the unfamiliar name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame   this is in any case rather to the side of what i was attempting to raise in my note as will become more evident below  as a nonbeliever i find michaels christianity kinder and gentler  blechhh  i think you are misreading me rather seriously  though given my principle that one cannot force ones own notion of sin on another and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism russel turpin and others believers and unbelievers alike are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of christian love  if i take him at his word he cannot condemn the inquisitors because they were also following these commandments as they understood them  if  you misread  i can do and have repeatedly done a complete bill of accusation against the inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings in the first place and to respect for let alone love of god in near succession  please go back to my quoted words above  the possibility that always exists is that i or to revert to proper time sequence my predecessors over the last several centuries could persuade christian b of my case that the inquisition does indeed constitute an egregious violation of the law of love  i must also note that the majority of christians have been so persuaded  by christian argumentation as well as by secular both christian and nonchristian prohibitions  what mr turpin alludes to is a trickier point  9a  i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved 9    in the inquisition  9b  the inquisitor responds that mother church must however 9    painful this seems discipline her children for their 9    own good  in this case the salvation of their souls or 9    if the tortured heretic will not recant than by bad example 9    deterring others from the same lossofsoul  9a  i point out that this justification of a failure in love 9    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of 9    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable  9b  burns me at the stake  my rhetoric has failed but the point i am making is sustained  what is going on here has a lot to do with cultural baggage  in this case the baggage includes a nearly universal and absolutely secular belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture  the elimination of inqisitorial practice in those places where it has been eliminated or at least greatly reduced has very little if anything to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between a and b  mr turpin is pointing out that if i am a versus the grand inquisitors b then my persuasion is not very likely to work  i know this and in what ever personal agony i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense attorney  so one possibility fails in this case  as it will fail in may others  at the other extreme the persuasion will succeed when it properly should not if it entails mistaken assumptions i share with the inquisitor  and that is potentially an even more troubling case in that many of the victims of inquisition will have accepted that they were in fact sinful in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them  the point is that the persuasion breaks down when the parties do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage  and given the main thrust of the inquisition against heresy it is bound to break down in precisely the worst cases  the conservative i dont think that is the right word btw will take refuge in what i attribute to b above that he is justified in causing harm because he thinks that works to a greater good  but this is a violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel as if ones theories about sin entitled one to cast aside jesus words on dealing with sinners cf matthew 539ff  i am a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously  or for that matter what does it mean to love ones fellow man and what is the right thing  and how does one go about loving god   well the whole point of making these the base commandments is that they arent reducible to rules  a set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting  such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies  but not if they are used instead of a personal involvement in and responsibility for ones actions  the great commandment is more than anything else a call to act as if you were god and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action  a demand that i like most would rather not hear but it keeps popping up nonetheless along with the reassurance that it is more important that i be open to trying this than succeeding at it  conservatives may twist this act as if you were god to mean lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they dont keep your rules they are so insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced a lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy is how god acts  that after all is the standard accusation against god by the atheists here and elsewhere  that the conservatives have confused their manipulative hoopjumping notions of coercing other people with the nature of god is almost the entire content of standard american atheism  and i quite agree with it on this point  ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo up front much of which sounds pretty much the same but by the specific acts procedures and arguments that they recommend  and different bodies of christians have from the beginning urged different ethical systems or in some cases none  as a result it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popular or infamous with christianity  christianity does not have a torah it does not have a quran  specifically christian scripture has very little if anything in the way of commandments  so little that the christians who desperately want commandments go mining for them with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation  for their efforts  the one single thing in the gospels which jesus specifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another  9i will be expanding on this point in a reply to paul hudson 9 that i hope to get to in a day or so  it is quite true that 9 some christians infer lots of commandments from the nt ill 9 point out what has to be going on in these inferences and why 9 there is a huge amount of cultural baggage involved  you are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethical system  but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do  it may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems  in which case i will profer the agapate allelou once again  i am glad that a few christians such as michael find a benign meaning for the goo and then interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive fashion  on the other hand i do think that this tells us more about michael and christians like him that it tells us about christianity   i think you are begging the question why dont i and the myriads of other christians like me tell you something about christianity nor is this very new in christianity  you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the quakers from the 17th century onwards and they are not at all the first to

769,769,from jbh55289uxacsouiucedu josh hopkins subject rimsat usrussian joint venture organization university of illinois at urbana lines 121   ive been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest ive  transcribed some of my notes below  since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine  permission is  granted to copy this without restriction  michael sternberg cheif of operations of rimsat was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control disarmament and international security  rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launchers and satellites  i think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the international relations program  the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson  went to tonga to visit a friend  while he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king who happened to be a big tv fan  matt bought the king a satellite dish which  the king thought was really nifty  since tonga has a gnp of about 70 million his majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this  matt thought there probably was so at his suggestion tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots  while this isnt entirely off the wall it was very unusual seeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and 31 is a lot of slots  the whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions supporting tongas case  eventually tonga ended up with 7 slots ranging from  70 e to 170 e slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside according to sternberg four of these from 130 e to 142 e are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and  the pacific rim   rimsat was formed to use these slots it was officially formed in nevis as a tax haven  they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately 2 billion  its not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware  they began  negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware  mr sternberg describes operating in  moscow in such harsh terms that i dont think ill visit there for a long time besides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way that people operate  for example everybody can sell you everything   everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by  eventually rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of 150 million  however glavkosmos lost favor after the coup  sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures  since glavkosmos was out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities  he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms  eventually he worked out a deal and on dec 4 1992 he met with koptev who heads the  russian space program to sign the deal  koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat  the next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware npo applied  mechanics  npo pm to use their acronym  this organization is located in  siberia cant figure out how to spell the town i need an atlas and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age  sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites  they are hard workers honest people who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners  at this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners   sternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm  his company is  apparently lookng for 100 million to invest in the firm to become 50 partnersit apparently costs the russians about 4 million to build a satellite that would sell for 50 million in the west  if you want to give them  specifications theyll build you a satellite  for the particular satellites that rimsat will be using costs run about 378000 per transponder year  this compares to 810000 ty in the us  they can sell their time for about 11 million compared to 26 million in the us  rimsat will launch their  satellites on protons  to get the best prices they bought in bulk  they  have the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address  the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians which is being moved into place now  tidbits    sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big business because big business is just like what they have over there except that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier    russian launches are self insured  the promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months    major investors in rimsat include russell 2020 which is a huge retirement fund organization cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast asia and a fund operated by some of the big names in us aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off    he downplayed the instabilites in the exussr saying that we are worried partly because we arent used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying monolith  italy gets a new government every two weeks but we dont worry  because were used to it  he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in russia we wont worry about their stability as much    part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money  the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting 25 in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in  rubles  to get around this rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian bank account  npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government    one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry  however intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites which was rather reassuring    the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime  the older gorizont horizon satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years  while this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites sternberg downplayed the  difference  at these prices they can afford to launch new ones  in addition shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date hardware    josh hopkins                                          jbh55289uxacsouiucedu 99    find a way or make one 9             attributed

boebertsctccom earl boebert writes lets say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything  on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true xy positions are known    now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danons excellent digitize program  that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to xy and saves those values when you click the mouse  upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values  this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you  the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretchingcontracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory  so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion  in particular if i have three sets of points   referencexy the known true values  distortedreferencexy the same points with known errors  distorteddataxy other points with unknown errors  what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors  i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy 3d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points  it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion  or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion  below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions feel free to poke me via email   assume locally smooth distortion  0 compute the delaunay triangulation of your xy points  this    defines the set of neighbors for each point  if your data are    not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull    consider deleting these edges  1 now there are two goals      a move the distorteddataxy to the referencexy     b keep the lengthe as measured from the current xys        as close as possible to the digitizedlengthe as measured         using the digitized xys  2 for every point compute a displacement based on a and b  for    example      a for xy points for which you know the referencexy you        can move alpha0referencexy  currentxy   this will        slowly move the distortedreferencexy towards the        referencexy      b for all other points examine the current length of each edge        for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength         take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the        point alpha1sumofedgedisplacements  this will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh  3 iterate 2 until you are happy for example no point moves very much  alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation   consider how much you believe the referencexy  ie do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges  warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially you cant allow the convex hull to change and you cant allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles  both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically retriangulating the points using  the current positions  but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions  when we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once  if i were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years i might go back and retriangulate on every iteration  if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other pointbut first read up on linear solutions to the nbody problem  there are lots of papers in the last 10 years of siggraph proceedings on springs constraints  and energy

784,784,from irfandavinciecewiscedu irfan alan subject a treatise on the miracles of muhammad saw part2 organization univ of wisconsinmadison electrical  computer engineering distribution usa lines 125   the following is an introduction as to who is muhammad saw as will be covered with this treatise  muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him saw is the last prophet of islam  he is the prophet who is revealed the last holy scripture quran by allah swa all praise be to him through the arch angel gabriel  he is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the quran by allah swa all praise be to him  muhammad saw lived between 571632 ac  all other prophethoods claimed after muhammad saw is a treason against islam against quran against the message of allah swa  muhammad saw is from the seed of ishmael another messenger of allah and son of abraham also a messenger of allah he is the messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming  the above mentioned verse from the quran is from  chapter 33 verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows  9muhammad is not the father of any of your men 9but he is the messenger of allah and the seal 9of the prophets and allah has full knowledge of 9all things   commentary on the above verse  when a document is sealed it is complete and there can be no further addition  the  holy prophet muhammad saw closed the long line of messengers allahs teaching is and will always be continuous but there has been and will be no prophet after muhammad saw  the later ages will want thinkers and revivers not prophets  this is not an arbitrary matter  it is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom for allah has full knowledge of all things   droplet vol 1 no 11 part 2  a   d r o p l e t from the vast ocean of the miraculous quran  translations from the arabic and turkish writings of  bediuzzaman said nursi the risalei noor  vol 1 no 11 part 2     99 nineteenth letter    99 mujizati ahmediye risalesi  a treatise on the miracles of muhammed saw         continued from droplet vol 1 no 11 part 1     second  sign   the  noble  messenger  saw declared his prophethood and presented to humanity a decree as the glorious quran and manifest miracles which number according to the scholars one thousand the occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as certain as the fact that he declared himself prophet  in fact as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the wise ouran even they could not deny the occurrence of his miracles but only called them hasha wa kellaallah forbids  sorcery in order to satisfy themselves or to deceive their followers  the miracles of muhammad saw have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of ulema scholars of islam to the hundreth degree    the miracle is the conformation by the creator of the universe of his declaration of prophethood it has the effect of the wordsyou have indeed spoken the truth     suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler while being observed by him the true ruler has appointed me to such and such position  at a time when you were asked to prove your claim the word yes uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you  or if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word yes    in the same way allahs most noble messenger claimed i am the envoy of the creator of this universe  my proof is that he will change his unbroken order at my request and my prayer  now look at my fingers  he makes them run like a fountain with five spigots  look at the moon by a gesture of my finger he splits it in two  look at that tree to affirm me and to bear witness to me it moves and comes near to me  look at this food although it is barely enough for two or three men it satisfies two or three hundred  further he shows hundreds of similar miracles  however the evidences  of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles  all his deeds and acts his words and behavior his moral conduct and manners his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness indeed many people  such  as  abdullah  b salam  the famous scholar of the children of israel came to belief merely by seeing him and said no lie can hide in this face nor can any fraud be found in it    although many of the  researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand there are thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of his prophethood  and hundreds of thousands of truthseeking men muhakkikiin with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways    the wise ouran alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness  since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away then the prophethood of muhammad saw is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others  for whatever evidences qualities  and attributes  became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as jesus as and moses as they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by muhammad saw  and since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of muhammad saw this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets   to be continued allah willing irfan alan a servant of islam  ,3

792,792,from parysccsuactstateuedu subject re a message for you mr president how do you know what happened keywords success lines 140 nntppostinghost ccsuactstateuedu organization yale university department of computer science new haven ct  i told some friends of mine two weeks ago that koresh was dead  the fbi and the batf could not let a man like that live  he was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies      now before everyone gets crazy with me let me say that koresh was crazy as  a bed bug but out government was crazierand they lied to us  they told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time  yet  whoever was watching the place failed to see that koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis  everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didnt pick him up then  there are two possible answers first they didnt see him  what kind of survaillance is that  second they didnt care  they wanted a confrontation  they wanted publicity and they got it  after the first battle they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming  they also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that well we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway  did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige  according to them they did but according to the hartford courant the woman that raised koresh his grandmother was not allowed to go in and see him                   the fbi agent who she spoke with was bob ricks and according to the paper he said  a lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out his grandmother raised vernon howell koreshs real name  she didnt raise david koresh  someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level  there is also an emotional level on which they can reach you  heres another one  all during this operation the fbi has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done  now they claim they never thought he would do it  i knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing  that was the start of the justification part part of the plan  thats when i knew it would come soon  but back to the plan  it is considered cruel and unusal punishment to execute criminals in the minds of many people but look at whats acceptable  they knew the parents adults had gas masks  they did not know or were not sure if the children had them  so the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound  the mothers seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with  i spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran i went through cbr chemical biological radiological warfare training  part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to  to make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin  you think its on fire  i have no doubts the children would become hysterical  its not the kind of thing you never want to do again  this was the plan the final solution  we waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from iran  we gave these people 51 days    i stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success  well fbi agent ricks changed my mind  again a newclip from the hartford courant  and while expressing regret at the loss of life he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt  it took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success  one more thought  the government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises                                                                 he had a license for the 50 caliber machine gun  they knew damn well he had one they also knew he had it legally  still without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him for all of this

 there is no such thing as nontoxic tear gas  tear gas is nonbreathable     remaining in its presence will cause nausea and vomiting followed eventually     by siezures and death  did the fbi know the

england wrote the  following as part of a book review section in this peoples magazine spring  1993 edition    i conclude with a little sermon because i believe we will not be a mormon   or humanfamily until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal liberal or conservative christian    or nonchristian  hal 8  when we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it american then exclude   those who dont fit it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good american might be one who doesnt draw   exclusive circles  that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central american ideal is by excluding others  and when we are tempted to   draw a circle around mormon or christian to decide who is orthodox   and who isnt by how much they agree with us it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of christs orthodoxy is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family    i recently spent some time in a christian bookstore in california the   service was excellent the clerks and customers all smiling neat and   wellscrubbed and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries sentimental fiction and collections of evangelistic sermons   but i was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others often viciouslywhether the political left our modern american   culture or other religions  a whole section was devoted to cults and the   occult and as you might expect mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment often by the same authors as satanism  and i found   i could either rent or buy in english or spanish copies of the god makers   that absurdly inaccurate even libelous but very popular and dangerous   antimormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the nazi films that scapegoated jews in the 1930s    it seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety perfect   love casteth out fear i john 418  i have always been pleased that the   lds church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths though i find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoatingand even threats of coercive   actionas the religious right wing has launched this year against the   political left and american cultural and religious styles they dont like   it is a fearful irony that in so doing mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked mormonspeople who would   if they had power forcefully restrict mormons rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil   the above sermon was addressed to the lds audience who usually subscribe to this peoples magazine but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of jesus christ to bring us back into his arms    even though the lds church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospelas in the days of christ the church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the church  i for one do not wish to be labelled christian if  those who profess themselves as christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent for example of the way my religion may interpret biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream christianity would give it  once again being in the  majority does not in and of itself prove anything except that your collective  voice is louder  thats really all the critics of the lds church have to stand on in terms of the kind of biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the lds church interpretation  using someone elses biased research of truths  and nontruths whose to say what the mixture is as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone least of all themselves

think he is pretty much objective in his treatment in race and slavery in the middle east since he clearly distinguishes between slavery under islam and the practice of slavery in other countries like the us prior to the civil war he also does not conceal that there are verses in the quran which promote the liberation of slaves what he doesnt and i dont think nobody can deduce from these verses is that slavery will eventually be abolished in islamic countries now you might rather conveniently blame the practice of slavery on muslims but the facts are out there i also fail to see the relevance of the claim of lewis being a zionist to what i wrote   regarding bernard lewis  him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and halftruths about islam  read

abolished at certain dates some 1200 years after muhammed that this was the cause of tensions in the ottoman empire between the arab slave traders and the government etc we also have in the asu library volumes of british documents on slavery where reports and documents concerning slavery all around the world can be found which i checked some of the incidents lewis mentions so i dont think ones political stance has anything to do with documentary evidence  i havent read lewiss article so i cant comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writings in general so far that his political motives make him a biased writer on islam  his antiislamic polemics as i understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling halftruths  again read orientalism by edward said  i am not asking you to take what i say on trust in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get this book it is a wellknown book and check the evidence out for yourself  the issue i raised was that slaves were used for sexual purposes when it was claimed that islam prohibits extramarital sex i wrote that the prophet himself had concubines i wrote an incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not want his concubine to get pregnant etc which is contrary to the notion that sex is for procreation only in other words such claims are baseless in the quran and the hadith  if slavery is in reality as opposed to in the practice of some muslims opposed by islam then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too  i seem to be unsuccesful in getting through to you islam is not advocating slavery slavery was an existing institution in the  7th century it advised on slaves being freed for good deeds etc which is nothing new many cultures saw this as a good thing what is the problem here but i can argue rightfully that slaves were discouraged about thinking about their statuses politically  the quran rewards the good slave so obey your master and perhaps one day youll be free  but it is very understandable that i do not communicate with muslims since they assume the quran is from a god and i think it is a rulebased system imposed on the society for preservation of the status quo slaves are a part of this system the subordination of women so that their function in society boils down to childmaking is a part of this system etc   i understand your point of view selim  i think rather it is us who are not getting through to you  some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before  regarding women i have made posting after posting on this subject showing that islam is not antiwoman etc  however have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them  i just reposted a very good one under the title islam and women reposted from socreligionislam  if this has already disappeared from your site then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this excellent article    imho your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient  regarding slaves my posting on slavery  the second one i made which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year  is based completely on the quran and contains numerous quranic verses and hadiths to support its point of view  our approaches are different  you are arguing from a historical standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the quran and hadiths  now just because people say they are muslims and perform a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is part of islam even if it is opposed by the quran and sunnah  no  of course not  let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you  the quran prohibits drinking  now if a person says i am a muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean that islam teaches that people should drink beer  of course not and only an idiot would think so  do you see my point  it is very natural to think that the authorauthors of the quran had no idea that the socioeconomic structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures  first with the end of  the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial  revolution  well rules have changed and the status quo has driven  muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a heathen world  muslim countries have failed economically they were unable to  accumulate any wealth  directly due to the uncomprimising economic rules in the quran in fact the rise of islam can easily be modeled after the pyramid effect  you do not produce any wealth at home but increase your wealth by conquering places    you are judging islam here on capitalist terms  capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth  this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking  islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist  this does not mean that islam does not support a freemarket  for it does in general  but there are other parts of  capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it  when this stopped you and i were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour no capital no industry very poor social services  the education level in muslim countries are the lowest in the world the health statistics are miserable etc   one can postulate numerous reasons for this  your theory is that it is because islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etc  selim i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think as you obviously do that islam  lack of education and power  for a large part of history the islamic world was very powerful  for a significant section of history the islamic world was the foremost in the sciences  so to say that islam is for example antieducation is completely absurd  you try to blame this situation on islam  history shows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other reasons for this situation  you blame muslims for not following the quran but i blame muslims  for following the quran   well selim your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of islam  i really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are following the quran or not  your idea is baseless from historical facts it is a poor utopia   the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage  yet somehow in your theory it is by following the quran that muslims are backwards in education  selim it is your thesis that is antihistorical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory   while my ideas are derived from social and economic history   you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it so far it seems to me that your view on islam being antieducation is quite contrary to history  that you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this  my solution to all muslims is simple cut the crap   i think selim you should consider taking your own advice  get the facts straight   here too  and work hard to reverse the effects of 1300 years of ignorance  selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of islam but also of islamic history particularly with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so i think  yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history  selim if i remember right you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from islam  i think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues and start reading some of our postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have   fred rice  dariceyoyoccmonasheduau    ,0

writes  rhoemer was the name of the guy responsible for much of the uniforms  and props used by the early nazis in their rallies and such  the name is roehm not rhoemer  and hitler does claim that he came up with the swastika business  but didnt he credit the actual flag design to a party member  some dentist or other i believe he gives such credit in mein kampf  he was killed in an early nazi purge he and many of his associates were flaming homosexuals well know also for their flamboyant orgies  i have been trying to find if there is any actual evidence for this common assertion recently  postings to such groups as sochistory and socculturegerman has not uncovered any netexperts who could provide any   well im no expert but all of the histories of nazi germany assert this they make reference to several scandals that occurred long before the night of the long knives the impression that i got was that homosexuality in portions of the sa was common knowledge also a book by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment called homosexuals in history asserts that roehm and heines were homosexuals as well as others in roehms sa circle  all the books say that roehm and his associate edmund heines were homosexual  i have been able to find nothing beyond that and suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend   well youre the one who is in germany if you dont believe the history books look up the primary sources yourself those of us outside of germany do not have access to these you do it seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances  several scandals the fact that on the knight of the long knives several sa members including heines were found sleeping together etc also i believe some people were complaining about the sas homosexual activities seducing young boys etc the histories that ive  read make a very convincing case none of this sounds like urban legend to me   irving a notoriously unreliable historian says that funk the nazi finance minister was homosexual  he gives no sources  i know next to nothing about irving and nothing about funk what precisely do you know that would contradict all of the other history books that i have read concerning the existence of homosexual nazis are you trying to say that  all historians are taking part in an antihomosexual smear what about  homosexual writers who agree with the official history dont you think they  would have found out the truth by now if roehm and heines were not homosexuals i would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from nazism no one  should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case   i challenge anyone to document this claim  if you are going to challenge all historians on this point not just irving then the burden of proof is on you track down the references find out where the stories originate from again you are the one in germany close to archival material  most people on the net are not  i have found a great deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the nazis  this seems to include all of the worst oneshitler himmler goebbels goering heydrich eichmann and many more  eh what is your agenda here to prove that the nazis were heterosexuals so that you can bash heterosexuals does it bother you that some of the nazis might have been homosexuals does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true of course not and what about bisexuals are they halfnazis  i dont know why it would be so difficult to believe that some nazis were homosexuals the german officer corps before ww1 for instance was notorious for its homosexuality there were numerous scandals which rocked the german govt during the late 19th and early 20th century many of the kaisers friends were prosecuted  the kaiser was no homosexual but the germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality going far back into prussian history  back to frederick the great at least who was himself a homosexual roehm was a  product of this prussian officer tradition and the old german army like the english public school system being a well known center of homosexuality would have been quite willing to overlook roehms homosexuality  in addition some nazis complained of homosexuality in the hitler youth the hitler youth swallowed up all prenazi youth groups and some of the various  prewar vandervogel bund and volkish youth groups were known to promote  homoerotic ideals and friendship and in many cases homosexuality itself so  it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual nazis  regardless of the official nazi dogmas concerning the evils of homosexuality why should this suprise anyone homosexuality has always existed in all  societies  it would be most unusual if the nazis were an exception  no i dont have any sources for you as i think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material and i do not have access  to these nor do i intend to reread every book on the nazis and on modern homosexuality that i have ever read  i dont have the time nothing is stopping you however from chasing down those sources until you prove otherwise though i will stick with the established histories                                                                              david matthew deane deanebinahccbrandeisedu be in me

840,840,from jbh55289uxacsouiucedu josh hopkins subject dcy trajectory simulation keywords ssto delta clipper organization university of illinois at urbana lines 91   ive been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest ive  transcribed some of my notes below  since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine  permission is  granted to copy this without restriction  note for newbies  the delta clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit reusable launch vehicle  the dcx vehicle is a 13 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in ssto  it is  currently undergoing tests  the dcy vehicle would be a full scale  experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit  it has not yet been funded  on april 6th rocky nelson of macdonnell douglas gave a talk entitled  optimizing techniques for advanced space missions here at the university of illinois mr nelsons job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements  although he is not directly involved with the delta clipper project he has spent time with  them recently using his software for their applications  he thus used  the dcy project for most of his examples  while i dont think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers i hope they arent  i fell asleep during that part i think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples  the first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit  the main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 gs  i assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints but i did not verify that  the delta clipper y version has 8 engines  4 boosters and 4 sustainers  the boosters which have a lower isp are shut down in  midflight  thus one critical question is when to shut them down  mr nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time                    3 g                                                  as ascii graphs go this is actually fairly                       9   good  the big difference is that the lines 2 g                            made by the    should be curves which are                                  concave up  the data is only approximate as                                  the graph wasnt up for very long 1 g                                                                       0 g                                                          100 sec    400 sec   as mentioned before a critical constraint is that g levels must be kept below 3  initially all eight engines are started  as the vehicle  burns fuel the accelleration increases  as it gets close to 3g the booster engines are  throtled back  however they quickly become inefficient at low power so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether  this causes the dip in  accelleration at about 100 seconds  eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the g level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely  the engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit  the trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly thus lowering the final altitude to  that desired  questions from the audience  paraphrased  q  would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs rather than     all at once  a  very perceptive  worth considering  they have not yet done the simulation    shutting down all four was part of the problem as given  q  so what was the final payload for this trajectory  a  cant tell us  read aviation leak  he also apparently had a good      propulsion example but was told not to use it    my question  does anyone know if this security is due to sdio protecting national security or md protecting their own interests  the second example was reentry simulation from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver  the biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating and  the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange  he showed graphs of heating using two different models to show that both were very similar and i think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate the end result was that for a polar orbit landing at ksc the dcy would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start its reentry profile about  60 degrees south latitude  i would have asked about the landing maneuvers but he didnt know about that aspect of the flight profile    josh hopkins                                          jbh55289uxacsouiucedu 99    find a way or make one 9             attributed to hannibal ,2
841,841,from tsacellarorg the silent assassin subject questions about plane eqn method of hidden surface removal organization the cellar bbs and public access system lines 18  what are the main advantages of this method  i have seen it described and the algiorithm seems a  little bit long  i developed my own method which requires that the points be in a counterclockwise order and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn method  it uses few calculations however basically it is several comparisons  the only disadvantage i see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand  my method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise  when looking at the back of something the points occur in an opposite direction from the front so merely by figuring out which way the points go you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon  has anyone heard of this method before  it is so simple i doubt i am the first to think of it  libertarian atheist semianarchal technorat  i define myselftsacellarorg ,1

that in mind i reprint without permission so sue me relevant information posted some years ago on this very problem  note the early use of postscript technology predating many of this years papers listed in the april 1st siggraph program announcement posted here a few days ago   eric   intersection between a line and a polygon undecidable 9by dave baraff tom duff  9from debcharismagraphicscornelledu 9newsgroups compgraphics 9keywords p np jordan curve separation ursyhon metrization theorem 9organization program of computer graphics  in article  ncsmithndsuvaxuucp timothy lyle smith writes    i need to find a formulaalgorithm to determine if a line intersects   a polygon  i would prefer a method that would do this in as little   time as possible  i need this for use in a forward raytracing   program  i think that this is a very difficult problem  to start with lines and polygons are semialgebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points  here are a few offthecuff ideas  first we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated  now the jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open and thus noncompact regions  thus the line lies completely inside the polygon the line lies completely outside the polygon or possibly but this will rarely happen the line intersects the polyon  now the phrasing of this question says if a line intersects a polygon so this is a decision problem  one possibility the decision model approach is to reduce the question to some other well known problem q and then try to solve q  an answer to q gives an answer to the original decision problem  in recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called postscript  see postscript language by adobe systems incorporated isbn  0201101793 co 1985  so given a line l and a polygon p we can write a postscript program that draws the line l and the polygon p and then outputs the answer  by output we mean the program executes a command called showpage which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon  a quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q and thus the original problem  there are two small problems with this approach   91 there is an infinite number of ways to encode l and p into the 9reduced problem q  so we will be forced to invoke the axiom of 9choice or equivalently zorns lemma  but the use of the axiom of 9choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days  92 more importantly the question arises as to whether or not the 9postscript program q will actually output a piece of paper or in 9other words will it halt  9now postscript is expressive enough to encode everything that a 9turing machine might do thus the halting problem for postscript is 9undecidable  it is quite possible that the original problem will turn 9out to be undecidable   i wont even begin to go into other difficulties such as aliasing finite precision and running out of ink paper or both  a couple of references might be  1 principia mathematica  newton i  cambridge university press cambridge    england

network for public perusal scrutiny     and distribution  digital immortality  the basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around nearforever  the gifs and jpgs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future  perhaps theyll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapesbut theyll be thereand someone will dig them up     if that doesnt interest you otis also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your worksa virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors  suddenly life is  breathed into your workand by merit of its stimulus it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons   spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts  keep your own copies of the images to look at when youve got the gumption thats what theyre here for    where               otis currently as of 42193 has two ftp sites      91412144135 projectsotis the uwi site 99 9sunsiteuncedu

get it scanned into an image file then either ftpput it in the contribincoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me email addresses at eof in email  after the image is received it will be put into the correct directory  computer originated works are also welcome  otis directories house two types of image files gif and jpg   gif and jpg files require oddly enough a gif or jpg viewer to  see  these viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large ftp sites around internet  jpg viewers are a bit tougher to find  if you cant find one but do have a gif viewer   you can obtain a jpgtogif conversion program which will change     jpg files to a standard gif format   otis also accepts animation files        when you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people to view  also include some biographical information on yourself well be having infofiles on each contributing artist and their works  you  can also just upload a textfile of info about yourself instead of  emailing  if you have pictures but no scanner there is hope  merely send copies to  the otis project co ed stastny po bx 241113 omaha ne 681241113  i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them  include an ample sase if you want your stuff back   also include information on each image preferably a 13 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where its finally put  if you have preferences as to what the images are to be named include those as well     conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and well arrange things  if you want to submit your works by disk peachy  merely send a 35 disk to the above address omaha and a sase if you want your disk back this is good for people who dont have direct access to encoders or ftp but do have access to a scanner  we accept disks in either mac or ibm compatible format  if possible please submit image files as gif or jpg  if you cantwe can convert from most formatswed just rather not have to  at senders request we can also fill disks with as much otis as they can stand  even if you dont have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an sase or 250 for disk postage and packing to  get a slabootis  as of 042193 were at about 18 megabytes of files and growing   email me for current archive size and directory    distribution  the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another  in fact we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such  if you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images     it would also be nice if youd send me a note when you did post images from otis to your local bbs  i just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is  its the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as possible  if you have the time please upload a few to your favorite bbs systemor even just post this infofile there  it would be keen of you    use  if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory youll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit  you will either find this in the rm file for     the image or series of imagesor in the artists directory under the  artists name  if permission isnt explicitly given then youll have  to contact the artist to ask for it  if no info is available email me edcwisunomahaedu and ill get in contact with the artist for  you or give you their contact information   when you do use permitted work its always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files    naming images  please keep the names of your files in dos format  that means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less  the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number thus leonardo devincis fifth mechanical drawing would be something like   9ldmek5gif     or    ldmek5jpg    or    ldmech5gif   etc  keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems        creating image files  when creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture  this gives people a reference in case theyd like to contact you  you may also want to include a title address or other information youd like people to know    hmmm  thats about it for now  more guidelines will be added as needed your input is

bates writes    in article nyikos734360987milomathscarolinaedu nyikosmathscarolinaedu peter nyikos writes   perhaps out  of dedication to your convictions i never never thought that you  would be consciously intellectually dishonest though    i am not  can you show me anything that would lead you to think   otherwise  see the spreading christianity thread in which he says i ignore certain statements that i specifically acknowledged and  dean did not  he called them the great commission but this is not descriptive of jesuss words in matt 1015  matt 1014 jerusalem bible translation  9and if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have 9to say as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust 9from your feet  matt 1015   9i tell you solemnly on the day of judgment it will not   9go as hard with the land of sodom and gomorrah as with   9that town  in the post to which dean is referring above i said   the above is a good description of kaflowitz who keeps harping on   shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what christ said next                                      the highlighted words refer to matt 1014 and 1015 respectively  and dean countered  actually this comment of yours is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are since i specifically acknowledged the great commission and the entreaty to spread the word  in fact it is the combination of the two statements i was addressing and not just the one and for you to characterize that as ignoring the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are  of course matt 1015 quoted above makes no mention of instruction to spread the word  all these quotes btw are from  messageid 1993apr131216243400cbnewsjcbattcom  in which at the end he claims i did not answer a question which i answered and which he deleted to get the chronology right he deleted the answer and then said i didnt answer  and i claim it correctly because my question went  do you too measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood  and the closest dean came to an answer was  peter peter peter  youre just so stupid pretentious dull and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is  of course this does not answer my question which has to do with posts in general and not my posts in particular  surely even dean knows this yet he brazenly asserts otherwise reinforcing his claim with an insult  so i now restore the answer to your question that you deleted  if youre still unable to figure it out ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you  it really doesnt take much sophistication to understand  on top of which i doubt that the answer is at all representative of deans true frame of mind  the insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of deans  mind throughout the 284line post from which these quotes were taken one wonders whether deans mind is so warped as to find sport in all this  he even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread  you made an ass of yourself by claiming that it 9999 was in the tradition of lent to make public announcements of  the sins of other individuals   false  i said it was the tradition to recall and atone for ones sins that i made public announcements of the sins of others sins btw that were a matter of public record documented in the posts of others is a different matter  many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins so i pointed some of them out  and i expressly set up a whole thread your turn to let people point out my sins to me  dean again  you made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to paint jews as plaster saints thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about jews and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made and then claiming i am ignoring the very argument i acknowledge  actually what happened was that dean made it seem like any jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to jewish customs  in doing so he was caricaturing jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding as well as implicitly slandering all jews who make public their acts of charity  i went very easily on dean for this giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about plaster saints  suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording  in an astonishing act of ingratitude dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us and using it as the basis of one insult after another

exploration of the saturnian     system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a titan ivcentaur in october of 1997     after gravity assists of venus earth and jupiter in a vvejga     trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004 upon     arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens     probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     titan the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about 3 hours     while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter     continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and     targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objectives of the     mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of saturns atmosphere     rings and magnetosphere conduct closeup studies of saturns     satellites and characterize titans atmosphere and surface      one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere these     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere      the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini 16251712 the     first director of the paris observatory who discovered several of     saturns satellites and the major division in its rings the titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan     huygens 16291695 who discovered titan and first described the true     nature of saturns rings  9 key scheduled dates for the cassini

would have some trouble giving up my children to 9someone who had just shot  what  two of them  9nb  it takes two sets of guns in a situation like this   yes i put the blame on koresh and similar

    orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists            claim to be looking for a unified field theory in which all            of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single            set of laws or equations  but they have been systematically            ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for 30 years                  the late physicist dewey b larsons comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe which he            calls the reciprocal system is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time                      1 the physical universe is composed entirely of one            component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete            units and in two reciprocal forms space and time                      2 the physical universe conforms to the relations of            ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are            absolute and its geometry is euclidean                      from these two postulates larson developed a complete            theoretical universe using various combinations of            translational vibrational rotational and vibrational           rotational motions the concepts of inward and outward            scalar motions and speeds in relation to the speed of light            which larson called unit velocity and the natural            datum                        at each step in the development larson was able to            match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the            real physical universe photons subatomic particles            incomplete atoms charges atoms molecules globular star            clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white            dwarf stars pulsars quasars etc even objects not yet            discovered then such as exploding galaxies and gammaray            bursts                            and applying his theory to his new

organization that was started to promote larsons theory             they have other related publications including the quarterly            journal reciprocity                         physicist dewey b larsons background                     physicist dewey b larson was a retired engineer            chemical or electrical  he was about 91 years old when he            died in may 1989  he had a bachelor of science degree in            engineering science from oregon state university  he            developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute            chemical properties based only on the elements used                      larsons lack of a fancy phd degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is            not a valid reason  sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to clearly see the forest through the trees  at the same            time it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox            physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer            well enough to point out all their contradictions ad hoc            assumptions principles of impotence inconsistencies etc                       larson did not have the funds etc to experimentally            test his theory  and it was not necessary for him to do so             he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other            researchers experimental and observational data  and in            many cases his explanation fit better                      a selfconsistent theory is much more than the orthodox            physicists and astronomers have  they claim to be looking            for a unified field theory that works but have been            ignoring one for over 30 years now                      modern physics does not explain the physical universe            so well  some parts of some of larsons books are full of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree  and remember that epicycles crystal spheres            geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed            to explain it well but were later proved conceptually wrong                           prof frank h meyer professor emeritus of uwsuperior            wasis a strong proponent of larsons theory and was or            still is president of larsons organization the            international society of unified science and editor of            their quarterly journal reciprocity  he moved to            minneapolis after retiring                   super collider boondoggle                           i am against contruction of the superconducting super            collider in texas or anywhere else  it would be a gross            waste of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific            value                      most physicists dont realize it but according to the            comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist            dewey b larson as described in his books the strange goofy            particles mesons hyperons alleged quarks etc            which they are finding in existing colliders fermi lab            cern etc are really just atoms of antimatter which are            created by the highenergy colliding beams and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment                      a larger and more expensive collider will only create a            few more elements of antimatter that the physicists have not            seen there before and the physicists will be even more            confused than they are now                      are a few more types of antimatter atoms worth the 83            billion cost  dont we have much more important uses for            this wasted money                            another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground            cables  how much poisoning of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the supercollider                                 naming the super collider after ronald reagon as            proposed is totally absurd  if it is built it should be            named after a leading particle physicist                     larsonian antimatter                           in larsons comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe antimatter is not a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles  it has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light            which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum                       in larsons theory a positron is actually a particle of            matter not antimatter  when a positron and electron meet            the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their            respective photons of which they are made neutralize each            other                        in larsons theory the antimatter half of the physical            universe has three dimensions of time and only one dimension            of space and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our            material half                      larsonian relativity                           the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets venus earth jupiter            etc  the remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help prove einsteins general theory of relativity                      but the late physicist dewey b larson achieved results            closer to the 43 seconds than general relativity can by            instead using special relativity  in one or more of his            books he applied the lorentz transformation on the high            orbital speed of mercury                      larson totally rejected general relativity as another            mathematical fantasy  he also rejected most of special            relativity including the parts about mass increases near            the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on            doppler shifts those quasars with redshifts greater than            1000 really are moving faster than the speed of light            although most of that motion is away from us in time                       in larsons comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe there are three dimensions of time instead            of only one  but two of those dimensions can not be measured            from our material half of the physical universe  the one            dimension that we can measure is the clock time  at low            relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are            negligible but at high speeds they become significant and            the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor            larson often used the term coordinate time when writing            about this                            in regard to mass increases it has been proven in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light  but the formula for acceleration is            acceleration  force  mass a  fm  orthodox physicists            are ignoring the third factor force  in larsons theory            mass stays constant and force drops toward zero  force is            actually a motion or combinations of motions or relations            between motions including inward and outward scalar motions             the expansion of the universe for example is an outward            scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of            the socalled big bang which is yet another mathematical            fantasy                                                                 the universe of motion                 i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe            of motion by dewey b larson 1984 north pacific            publishers po box 13255 portland oregon  97213 456            pages indexed hardcover                      it contains the astrophysical portions of a general            unified theory of the physical universe developed by that            author an unrecognized genius more than thirty years ago                      it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical            mysteries including the formation of galaxies binary and            multiple star systems and solar systems the true origin of            the 3degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma           ray bursts and the true nature of quasars pulsars white            dwarfs exploding galaxies etc                      it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all            looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with            open minds                      the following is an example of his theorys success            in his first book in 1959 the structure of the physical            universe larson predicted the existence of exploding            galaxies several years before astronomers started finding            them  they are a necessary consequence of larsons            comprehensive theory  and when quasars were discovered he            had an immediate related explanation for them also                    gammaray bursts                 astrophysicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious gammaray bursts  they were            originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the            disc of our galaxy  but the new gamma ray telescope now in            earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly and their source locations in space do not            correspond to any known objects except for a few cases of            directional coincidence                      gammaray bursts are a necessary consequence of the            general unified theory of the physical universe developed by            the late physicist dewey b larson  according to page 386 of            his book the universe of motion published in 1984 the            gammaray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the            antimatter half of the physical universe which larson calls            the cosmic sector  because of the relationship between the            antimatter and material halves of the physical universe and            the way they are connected together the gammaray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at            random  this is why the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects and come from all            directions uniformly                      i wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gammaray burst to kill all or most            life on earth  there would be no way to predict one nor to            stop it                      perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were            actually caused by nearby gammaray bursts                   larsonian binary star formation                           about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double  but orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them                      but binary star systems are actually a likely            consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of            the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey            b larson                      i will try to summarize larsons explanation which is            detailed in chapter 7 of his book the universe of motion            and in some of his other books                      first of all according to larson stars do not generate            energy by fusion  a small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse  the rest results from the complete            annihilation of heavy elements heavier than iron  each            element has a destructive temperature limit  the heavier the            element is the lower is this limit  a stars internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements                      when the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of iron there is a type i            supernova explosion  this is because there is so much iron            present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process which larson explains in some            of his books better than i can                      when the star explodes the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light  the heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light because of the high temperature  the            explosion pushes that material over the speed of light and            it expands outward in time which is equivalent to inward in            space and it often actually disappears for a while                      over long periods of time both masses start to fall            back gravitationally  the material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a red giant star  the            material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a            white dwarf star  both stars then start moving back toward            the main sequence from opposite directions on the hr            diagram                      the chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space making a single lone star            again are near zero  they will instead form a binary            system orbiting each other                       according to larson a white dwarf star has an inverse            density gradient is densest at its surface because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed blown            outward in time   this eliminates the need to resort to            mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter neutron            stars black holes etc                   larsonian solar system formation                 if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively small then instead of a single            white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf            stars revolving around the red giant star but probably            still too far away in threedimensional time to be affected            by its heat etc  these will become planets                        in chapter 7 of the universe of motion larson used all            this information and other principles of his comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe to derive            his own version of bodes law                         black hole fantasy                 i heard that physicist stephen w hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black            holes merging together into a single black hole and            concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than            the sum of the two original black holes                      such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red            flag causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black            holes etc                      after reading physicist dewey b larsons books about            his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical            universe especially his book the universe of motion it is            clear to me that black holes are nothing more than            mathematical fantasies  the strange object at cygnus x1 is            just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black            hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to prove their theory                           by the way i do not understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist stephen hawking  the physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if hawkings severe physical            problem somehow makes him wiser  it does not                      i wish the same attention had been given to physicist            dewey b larson while he was still alive  widespread            publicity and attention should now be given to larsons            theory books and organization the international society of            unified science                                             electromagnetic propulsion                 i heard of that concept many years ago in connection            with ufos and unorthodox inventors but i never was able to            find out how or why they work or how they are constructed                      i found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112113 of the book basic properties of matter by            the late physicist dewey b larson which describes part of            larsons comprehensive general unified theory of the physical            universe  i quote one paragraph                      as indicated in the preceding chapter the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance             the electrons we find are derived from the environment  it            was brought out in volume i larsons book nothing but            motion that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities and that            although the motions that constitute these electrons are in            many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited  it follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector material half of the            universe most of which are uncharged  in this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space because they are inherently rotating units of space            and the relation of space to space is not motion  in open            space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system in the manner of a photon  in the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron            like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system  all            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment

material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level                            note that in larsons theory uncharged electrons are            also massless and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning            around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate             unit velocity is

true then the electromagnetic propulsion            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons or other particles in space perhaps giving them a            charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion in larsons theory an electrical charge            is a onedimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the            rotation of the particle                        the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused

         discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals            in the us and elsewhere  and at least the basic principles            of larsons theory should be included in all related

971,971,from ederhsvaicboeingcom dani eder subject re guns for space keywords sopa gun space launcer organization boeing ai center huntsville al lines 72   okay lets get the record straight on the livermore gas gun   the project manager is dr john hunter and he works for the laser group at livermore  what you may ask does gas guns have to do with lasers nothing really but the gun is physically located across the road from the free electron laser building and the fel building has a heavily shielded control room thick walls from which the gun firings are controlled  so i suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience  i visited hunter at the beginning of feb and we toured the gun at the time i was working on gas gun rd at boeing where i work but i am now doing other things helping to save the space station  the gun uses a methaneair mixture which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch id ie it looks like a pipe the chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred ms down the chamber  on the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres  the piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures at around 50000 psi the barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore  it is mounted at right angles to the chamber ie they intersect  this was done so that in the future the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber  the projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of lexan plastic 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long  all of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel  the barrel is evacuated and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film a little thicker than saran wrap  the plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile    the gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs  in the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found  at the higher speeds in later testing the projectile vaporizes  the testing is into a bunker because the livermore test range is about 3 miles across and the projectile would go 100200 km if fired for maximum range  the intent is to move the whole gun to vandenberg afb after the testing is complete where they can fire into the pacific ocean and use the tracking radar at vafb to follow the projectiles  the design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 kms half of orbital speed  so far they have reached 2 kms and the gun is currently down for repairs as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware i think it had to do with the methaneair more detonating than burning but i havent had a chance to talk to hunter directly on this  there are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air at mach 12 4 kms since the most you can get in wind tunnels is mach 8  this gun cost about 4 million to develop and is basically a proofofconcept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful sized payloads into space  this would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit  dani eder    dani edermeridian investment company2054642697w2327467h rt1 box 1882 athens al 35611location 34deg 37 n 86deg 43 w 100m alt ,2

973,973,from kempmpphoenixoulufi petri pihko subject re concerning gods morality long organization university of oulu finland xnewsreader tin version 11 pl6 lines 215  this kind of argument cries for a comment  jbrownbatmanbmdtrwcom wrote  in article 1993apr309522024632lelandstanfordedu galahadlelandstanfordedu scott compton writes  jim you originally wrote    god did not create  disease nor is he responsible for the maladies of newborns     what god did create was life according to a protein code which is  mutable and can evolve  without delving into a deep discussion of  creationism vs evolutionism god created the original genetic code  perfect and without flaw             do you have any evidence for this if the code was once perfect and has degraded ever since we should have some evidence in favour of this statement shouldnt we  perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full of noncoding regions introns which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions exons an impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains  is the number of introns decreasing or increasing it appears that intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exonintron structure in their genes   on the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted later presents several logical difficulties introns are removed by a splicing mechanism  this would have to be present but unused if introns are inserted moreover intron insertion would have required precise targeting  random insertion would not be tolerated since sequences for intron removal selfsplicing of mrna are conserved besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace  long terminal repeats and target  site duplications and these are not found in or near intron sequences   i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting theological arguments like this  try watsons molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish  baltimores molecular biology of the cell for starters   remember the question was posed in a theological context why does  god cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a  theological perspective  my own  it is no less valid than a purely  scientific perspective just different  scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion    i think you misread my meaning  i said god made the genetic code perfect  but that doesnt mean its perfect now  it has certainly evolved since  for the worse would you please cite a few references that support your assertion your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence  in fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than weve thought  for instance sex might have evolved as defence against parasites this view is supported by computer simulations of evolution eg tierra     perhaps  i thought it was higher energy rays like xrays gamma  rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage  in fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action    actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the  time when god created life  according to my recollection most  biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago  after  all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth  was created  it would still be too primitive to support life  i  seem to remember a figure more like 25 to 3 billion years ago for  the origination of life on earth  anyone with a better estimate  id replace created with formed since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one most recent estimates of the age of the earth range between 46  48 billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but organic stromatolitelike layers date back to 35 billion years this would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve  im sorry i cant give any references this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i attended here    dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer  diseases both bacterialviral and genetic  although the forces of  natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the  degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this    again do you want this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed degeneration   i can understand scotts reaction    excuse me but this is so farfetched that i know you must be   jesting  do you know what pathogens are  do you know what    point mutations are  do you know that everything can come   about spontaneously      in response to your last statement no and neither do you  you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you  cannot know that  i hope you dont forget this we have evidence that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against this conclusion in science one does not have to believe in  anything it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present ones own conclusions prior to this   theology does not use this method therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions   human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely  affecting our wellbeing and ability to fight off disease while the   simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in   causing infection and disease  it is a bad combination  hence  we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial  diseasesdisorders  you are supposing a purpose not a valid move bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease they are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution  only replication saves replicators from degradiation we are just an efficient method for our dna to  survive and replicate the less efficient methods didnt make it  to the present   and for the last time  please present some evidence for your claim that human dna is degrading through evolutionary processes some people have claimed that the opposite is true  we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade i havent seen much evidence for either claim    but then i ask so  where is this relevant to my discussion in  answering johns question of why  why are there genetic diseases  and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require  babies to develop antibodies  is it gods fault the original  question  i say no it is not  of course nothing evil is gods fault  but your explanation does not work it fails miserably    you may be right  but the fact is that you dont know that  satan is not responsible and neither do i    suppose that a powerful evil being like satan exists  would it  be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills  that affect mankind  i dont think so  he could have done a much better job pun intended the problem is it seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution   did i say that  where  seems to me like another bad inference  actually what youve done is to oversimplify what i said to the  point that your summary of my words takes on a new context  i  never said that people are meant presumably by god to be  punished by getting diseases  why i did say is that free moral  choices have attendent consequences  if mankind chooses to reject  god as people have done since the beginning then they should not  expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic  universe  i am not expecting this if god exists i expect him to leave us alone i would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free this is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not as clearcut as it seems to be  what consequences would you expect from rejecting allah     oh i admit its not perfect yet  but im working on it    a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point   what does this have to do with the price of tea in china or the  question to which i provided an answer  biology and genetics are  fine subjects and important scientific endeavors  but they explain  how god created and set up life processes  they dont explain  the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution  why is there a why behind and your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence this is why we recommend these books  is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological theories hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this    thanks scotty for your fine and sagely advice  but i am  not highly motivated to learn all the nittygritty details  of biology and genetics although im sure id find it a  fascinating subject  for i realize that the details do  not change the big picture that god created life in the  beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its  environment  im sorry but they do there is no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation it can come into existence without a supreme being  try reading pw atkins creation revisited freeman 1992

981,981,from richbellaceraamailamdahlcom subject part 1 and part 2  re homosexuality lines 114 returnpath amailamdahlcomrichbellacerajutscccamdahlcom  tony  i read your post it was nothing new i had seen much the same in other typicalchristian antigay sentimental literature  gay people are and will con tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates  you may be unaware of all the statistica findings concerning africanamericans that have been published and used by various groups to reenforce their own bias against africanamericans  we usually think of the kkk in these instances but there are many other groups  of course the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today but that was not always the case fortunately africanamericans had whites who supported their cause and public sentiment was eventually if not entirely turned around  there was even a civil war and antinegro sentiment increased  in fact until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them  i know many gays and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination  you may think that i have been deceived or something that is your perogative  my church christian church disciples of christ openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society including gays  we believe the gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples  we believe in the lords great commandment to love and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed even if it is not popular to do so  i really like my church for last reason the most  i can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the gospel and believes in the commandment of love though im hardpressed to find many who actually sho love but not many are willing to champion the oppressed especially within their own community  i may have lost face with the greater christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of africanamericans  many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being niggerlovers and such  i guess ive decided the challenge is worth it  in my talks with gay men and women i have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process etc  funny thing is i dont know of one case where the parents exwives or even children have continued to reject their gay family member son daughter exhusband father etc after they began to take part in some form of support group like pflag  im apalled by the legislation which passed in colorado and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as louis sheldon from the tradition values coalition have been actively working in the christian underground to garner support within several 8 i believe states this coming november for more oppressive legisation against gays  perhaps you dont get it and maybe you never will  many didnt get it in the middle ages and the proclaimed gods will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions  the message that comes through loud and clear by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general is that there is a strong dislike even hatred for gays whether you want to call it such or not it doesnt change the results  the major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end the final effect of posts like that of yours and mr hudson is that you have a conditional love for gays  condition  change and well love you this is sure strange coming from a group who claim that god has an unconditional love one that calls people just as they are  sure there are things that will naturally change and habits like alcoholism wife beating etc that need to be changed through some sort of therapy  but then there are things like lefthandedness etc that no amount of beating it out of people is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other peoples expectations in the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuperspirituality  this is sad but i thoroughly believe that one day it will change  it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like sexuality a taboo subject even today but i firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms  its funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repressionas though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society gay people are not criminals  another interesting thing happened recently  a very prominent charismatic church in the silicon valley here had two of its pastors arrested for self admitted charges of pederasty men having sex with boys  this had apparently been going on for some time a couple years but since the charges were voluntary and the church worked closely with the police so i imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media  how could such a thing happen when the church itself has an exgay ministry  one of my friends recently told me he was approached by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry  these are difficult times we live in but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the christian community  the results of the passing amendment in colorado has created an organization whos posters are appearing all over colorado called straight i forget the whole definition off hand but the last part was against immoral gross homosexual trash and their motto is working for a fagfree america with an implicit advocation for violence  this is sick and it seems to be what you and mr hudson and others are embracing  we christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel dont measure up and constant beratement from organizations like the christian research institute while they do have a good purpose also their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people  the gospel i believe is not so negative rather it seeks ways to include people  i have several of dr martins books and find them quite helpful especially concerning cults but it seems that cri has become a cult unto itself  why dont we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away  whatever  rich  ,3

tin version 11 pl6 lines 162  cwainwright eczcawmipsnottacuk wrote  i   jim      i always thought that homophobe was only a word used at act up   rallies i didnt beleive real people used it lets see if we agree   on the terms definition a homophobe is one who actively and   militantly attacks homosexuals because he is actually a latent   homosexual who uses his hostility to conceal his true orientation   since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality is a   homophobe your implication is clear it must necessarily follow that   all men are latent homosexuals or bisexual at the very least       crap crap crap crap crap  a definition of any type of phobe comes from  phobia  an irrational fear of  hence a homophobe not only in act up meetings  the word is apparently in general use now  or perhaps it isnt in the bible    wouldst thou prefer if i were to communicate with thou in bilespeak    does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider  does an  agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space  do you  understand english    obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it  they will do their best  to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or  run away  or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes  people  who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or  cause them or themselves violence    isnt that what i said  what are you taking issue with here your remarks are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful        it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function   other than limiting population growth since evolution only occurs   when the members of one generation pass along their traits to   subsequent generations homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend if i   take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to   intend then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our   species at least is going nowhere       so every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children  hmmno wonder the world is overpopulated  obviously you keep to the  monty python song  every sperm is sacred  and if as you say it has  a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own   arguement natural  consider the context im talking about an evolutionary function one of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate those who dont have no purpose in that context      another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to   survive the participation of both parents is necessary  a family must   exist since homosexuals do not reproduce they cannot constitute a   family since the majority of humankind is part of a family   homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you   will       well if that is true by your own arguements homosexuals would have   vanished years ago due to nonprocreation  also the parent from single  parent families should put the babies out in the cold now cos they must  by your arguement die  by your argument homosexuality is genetically determined as to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context means i am talking about evolution the preservation of the species the fundamental premise of the whole process     but it gets worse since the overwhelming majority of people actually   prefer a heterosexual relationship homosexuality is a social   abberation as well the homosexual eschews the biological imperative   to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in   the most fundamental social element the family but wait theres   more       read the above  i expect you to have at least ten children by now with  the family growing  these days sex is less to do with procreation admittedly  without it there would be noone but more to do with pleasure  in prepill  and precondom days if you had sex there was the chance of producing children  these days is just aint true  people can decide whether or not to have   children and when  soon they will be able to choose its sex c but thats   another arguement so its more of a lifestyle decision  again by  your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they must  be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children  both are   as unnatural as each other  yet another nonsequitur sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental that homosexuals dont procreate means that sex is only recreation and nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose      since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some   policy makers that they have civil rights they are now claiming that   their sexuality is a preference a lifestyle an orientation a   choice that should be protected by law now if homosexuality is a mere   choice and if it is both contrary to nature and antisocial then it   is a perverse choice they have even less credibility than before they   became prominent        people are people are people  who are you to tell anyone else how to live  their life  are you godtm  if so fancy a date  heres pretty obvious dodge do you really think youve said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement i am not telling anyone anything i am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality providing its a merely an alternate lifestlye that are not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand i realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis but if you are to be consistent you have no case in this regard     to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to   ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of   the homosexual lifestyle but since the charge is only intended to   intimidate its really just demogoguery and not to be taken   seriously fact is jim there are far more persuasive arguments for   suppressing homosexuality than those given but consider this a start       again crap  all your arguments are based on outdated ideals  likewise the  bible  would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned by  a bastard to eternal damnation  or someone who crushes his penis either  accidently or not  both are in deuteronomy  im sure your comment pertains to something but youve disguised it so well i cant see what where did i mention ideals outdated or otherwise your arguments are very reactionary do you have anything at all to contribute      as to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in   scouting the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from   teaching by their own logic homosexuals are deviates social and   biological since any adult is a role model for a child it is   incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from   those who would do the child harm in this case harm means primarily   social though that could be extended easily enough          you show me anyone who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as  normal and will take of my hat puma baseball cap to you  one mans meat  is another mans poison    what has this got to do with anything would you pick a single point that you find offensive and explain your objections i would really like to believe that you can discuss this issue intelligibly  bill   ,0

bskendignetcomcom brian kendig writes  and i maintain  some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters because they fear it they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own terms  and so by their own choice they will remain in darkness sort of like bugs under a rock  however some people but not many will not like the darkness  sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable these people will crawl out from under the rock and although blinded at first will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth  and after a while now that they can see things for what they really are they will also see the heights which they can reach and the places they can go and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes   are you your own master  do you have any habits that you cannot break for one you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the bible  seems that ignorance has you mastered  how about sexual sins  gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of   do you dehumanize women when they walk past you  do you degrade them to a sex object in your head  are you the master of that kind of thinking  do you insult people unknowingly then regret it later  yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself  are you truly the master of yourself  i have admitted that i am not the master of my thought life at all times that i sometimes say things i do want to say and then repeat my mistake unwantingly  i have admitted to myself that i cannot control every aspect of my being  there are times i know i shouldnt say something but then say it anyway  there are times i simply forget a lesson i in fact am not my own master  i need help  jesus promised me this help  and i took him up on his offer  i have willfully let jesus be my master because jesus knows what is better for me than i myself do  and why not  does not the creator know his creation better than the creation  does toyota know whats better for the corolla than the corolla  do you see my point  i think youre the one under the rock and im getting a great tan out here in the sunlight  my life has improved immesurably since i abandoned theism  come and join me  it will be a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the long hike but its well worth it  then i guess ignorance is bliss for you  because brian you enjoy not having a clue about the bible     dont you see  im not going to accept anything that i cant witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not something as megapowerful as what youre trying to get me to accept surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good reason to dont you   can you witness motherly love with your senses  how does caring and concern for you register with your senses  if nothing registers to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch then you better become a vulcan and fast  you better get rid of your emotions  and i do have a good reason to believe what i do   when did i say that  i say that i would rather cease existing instead of being subject to the whims of a deity but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who i am then so be it  the topic was about my god and your lack of knowledge about what my god says   my god says that you will not cease existing  you have life forever  you can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever or can choose to  live it in paradise with god  that is what my god says  and that was the issue  your madeup theism is what it ismade up  its wishful thinking   nope  most people are christian  most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect of believing that the world is an undesirable place of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again of doing just as their priests tell them like good little sheep  you enjoy darkness and youre proud of it  is this the religion of kendigianism  most people are not christian  most people including christians  are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect  is the world an undesireable place a doctrine of kendigianism  it has nothing to do with my god  does kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship mine doesnt  does kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again   mine doesnt  does kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep  mine doesnt  is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being  ignorant of the bible  brian following christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of kendigianism you would find any of your doctrines in the bible   i dont follow kendigianism i follow christ   also to try to again show you your ignorance of christ and the bible in regards to priests  have you not read about the sole melchizedek priest in hebrews 7 and 8  have you not read what the purpose is of the old testament levitical priesthood and why there should not be priests today  yes guess what  the catholics messed up  i do not follow catholicism or any ism  i follow christ  nope  you make decisions enjoy your successes and accept your failures then you die  if you are content with the life youve led as you reflect back on it in your final moments then youve led a good life  why would you want to live a good life to you you die and thats it  dont contradict yourself  you have no reason to live a good life  it doesnt do you any good in the end  your life doesnt do anybody else any good  either because everyone dies anyway  so you have no reason to lead a good life leading a good life is meaningless   why do you do such a meaningless thing  im sorry i dont feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god id worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case its not really all that important  has the resurrection sunk in  jesus is alive  jesus is not dead jesus was sacrified

1025,1025,subject re lds ricks reply from isscckbyuvmbitnet organization brigham young university lines 159   robert weiss psyrobtwubvmsbccbuffaloedu writes  rick anderson replied to my letter with  ra in article c5elp2l0cacsubuffaloedu ra psyrobtwubvmsbccbuffaloedu robert weiss says ra     just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing you refer to  differing interpretations of create and say that many christians may  not agree so what that is really irrelevant we do not base our faith  on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line is  truth regardless of popularity of opinions  it may be irrelevant to you and your personal beliefs or should i say bias but it is relevant to me and many others  youre right the bottom line is truth independant from you or anyone else  since you proclaim truths as a selfproclaimed appointee may i ask you by what authority you do this  because it says so in the bible  does the bible say so or is it you or someone else who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or disapproval  excuse moi but your line of truths havent moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous  of all the preachers of truth on this net you have struck me as a selfrighteous member of the wrecking crew with no positive message to me or other latterday saints whatsoever btw this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by jesus to the pharisees ye hypocrites    ye preach about me with your lips but your hearts are far removed from me   also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created  and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the mormon  belief you cant grant your conclusion and then expect the point to  have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address  and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the  conclusion that you grant  sophistry  look whos talking jumping to conclusions  you wouldnt do that yourself right  all you address is your own convictions regardless whether we come up with any biblical scriptures which supports our points of view because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever    the bible states that lucifer was created  the bible states that jesus  is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds  belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same  a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine  the former kgb would have loved to employ you jesus and lucifer are not the same silly and you know it     the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is  nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible  says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god  correction it may contradict would you think the bible says  the bible indeed does teach that not all are children of god in the sense that they belong to or follow god in his footsteps  satan and his followers have rebelled against god and are not children followersredeemed of god but it doesnt mean that they were not once created by god but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow god and his plan of salvation           the field is the world the good seed are the children of the         kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one         matthew 1338  so  this illustrates nicely what i just said the children of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of jesus and have shown works of repentance etc and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against god and the lamb  the issue of satans spiritoffspring and those who followed him has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your bible  you purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your right with non related scriptures  lots of nice scriptures deleted not robert w copyrighted though  ra  we are told that and this is life eternal that they might know ra  thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent ra  john 173 life eternal is to know the only true god yet the ra  doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly ra  different jesus a jesus that cannot be reconciled with the jesus of ra  the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim  correction my jesus is indeed different than your jesus and can be reconciled with the jesus in the bible  not your interpretation of him i concur but i honestly couldnt care less  ra  one as being true denies the other from being true according to the ra  bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god and ra  not the construct of imagination  in this single posting of yours ive seen more constructs of imagination than in all of the prolds mails combined i have read so far in this news group  first get your ldsfacts straight before you dare preaching to us about the only true god whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes but whose image i cannot reconcile with what i know about him myself  i guess your grandiose selfimage does not allow for other faiths believing in the divinity of jesus christ but in a different way or fashion than your own  not that it really matters the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visited every continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear    this is really a red herring it doesnt address any issue raised but   rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read   something into the bible doesnt change what the bible teaches  sigh  what the bible teaches  or what the bible teaches according to robert weiss and co  i respect the former i reject the latter without the remotest feeling that i have rejected jesus  on the contrary  and by the way i do respect your interpretations of the bible i even grant you being a christian following your own image of him as much as i am a christian following my own image of him in my heart      most of the other replies have instead hopscotched to the issue of   bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine i dont   think that it matters if mcconkies views were canon that is not the   issue  were mcconkies writings indicative of mormon belief on this   subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may   certainly be  the issue is of course that you love to use anything to either mis represent or ridicule the lds church  the issue of official doctrine is obviously very important  mcconkies views have been controversial eg the seven deadly heresies has made me a heretic   at best or erroneous at worst blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation  i respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church but i personally do not rely on his personal interpretations his book mormon doctrine is oftentimes referred to as mcconkies bible in mormon circles on mormon doctrine  i rather look to official doctrinal sources and to hugh nibleys books the last comment is an ldsinsider reference  summarizing mcconkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of god than i have but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation  but having said this i find mcconkie even in his most biased and speculative moments far more thoughtprovoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen  im somewhat appalled that i have allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting   robert weiss psyrobtwubvmsccbuffaloedu   casper c knies

article 9304191157076f2rusnewsw165wmantiscouk mathew mathewmantiscouk writes  which liberal news media are we talking about    western news in general but in particular the american mass media  cbs nbc abc etc  the general tone of the news during the whole  war was one of those poor poor iraqis along with look how precisely  this cruise missile blew this building to bits    most odd  over here there was very little about the suffering of the iraqi  civilians until towards the end of the war and then it was confined to the  few remaining quality newspapers  true  at first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets  but later and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone  it seemed to me that they didnt have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare  its like they were only progulfwar as long as it was nice and clean smart missiles dropping in on military hqs but not when pictures of dead dying and maimed civilians started cropping up  what naive hypocrites     how about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in ww2  i dont hear you bemoaning them   discussion about blanketbombing and abombs deleted    all things considered the firebombings and the atomic bomb were  essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick                               end to avoid even greater allied losses  i should have said here militarily justified  it seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified i apologize     what about the evidence that america knew japan was about to surrender after  hiroshima but before nagasaki  is that another lie peddled by the liberal  media conspiracy  i have often wondered about this  ive always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on japans island fortress of truk  a good inpenatrable military target  the second bomb couldve been held back for use on an industrial center if need be  but i digress  yes i have heard that we found evidence after the war btw that japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb  unfortunately the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the uss ulimatum  therefore the second bomb was dropped  most unfortunate imo     i for one dont regret it    nuke a jap for jesus    i dont regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people  but i do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions       why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet  if iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks  before we started bombing    i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the  west before the war  it is evident that the west especially america  misjudged hussein drastically  but once hussein invaded kuwait and   threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the worlds  oil supply he had to be stopped    oh i see  so we can overlook his using chemical weapons on thousands of  people but if he threatens your right to drive a huge gasguzzling car  well the mans gotta go  actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us and allied action  if some backwater country took over some other backwater country we probably wouldnt intervene  not that we dont care but we cant be the worlds policman  or if a coup had occured in kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldnt have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to saudi arabia  but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the wests oil  interests caused us to take action      ive moved a paragraph from here to later on         if we hadnt intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would  have been appeasement    right  but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action  or  are you just setting up a strawman    im not setting up a strawman at all  if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait  diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective                                                             i guess we  shouldnt have fought ww2 either  just think of all those innocent  german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg    yes do  germans are human too you know    sure  what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in  his grandiose quest for a thousand year reich  the consequences  stemmed from that    translation they were asking for it   well in a sense yes  they probably had no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to   but what about those who didnt support hitlers dreams of conquest  its  not as if they democratically voted for all his policies  the nsdap got 43  in the elections of 1933 and that was the last chance the german people got  to vote on the matter  they suffered along with the rest  why does this bother you so much the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect  many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others  it it regretable but thats thewayitis  there are no perfect solutions      i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and  tibet   what should i say about them  anything in particular    the people of east timor are still being killed by a dictatorship that  invaded their country  hell even western journalists have been killed  all  this was happening before the gulf war  why didnt we send in the bombers to  east timor  why arent we sending in the bombers now  probably because were not the saviors of the world  we cant police each and every country that decides to selfdestruct or invade another  nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other places     heres that paragraph i moved     whats your intent  to sound like a loving christian  well you arent  doing a very good job of it    well its not very loving to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up  nearby countries and keep them  or to allow them to continue with mass  slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion  so id have to  say yes stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the  most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest    the chinese government has a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization  of tibetans  tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed  amnesty  international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china    why arent we stopping them  in fact why are we actively sucking up to them  by trading freely with them  tell me how we could stop them and ill support it  i for one do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it i agree that it is deplorable     and as for poor poor rodney king  did you ever stop and think why  the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty    yes  amongst the things i thought were hmm theres an awful lot of white  people in that jury    so  it was the policemen on trial not rodney king    erm surely its irrelevant whos on trial  juries are supposed to represent  a crosssection of the population  are they  or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held  normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order  im not an expert on california law or even us law but it seems that this is the way the system is set up  you can criticize the system but lets not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around     and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers    you are saying that black people are not the peers of white people  no not at all  the point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant     this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow    this idea of people only being tried before a jury of people just like them  is really stupid  should the nuremburg trials have had a jury entirely made  up of nazis  germans perhaps  peers doesnt mean those who do the same thing like having murderers judge murderers  it means having people from the same station in life presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendents motivations     those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those  policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape  but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i  have not seen    when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone whos lying defenceless on  the ground its rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have  been    so  its hard to imagine  so when has argument from incredulity  gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing a logical  argument    were not talking about a logical argument  were talking about a court of  law  as the faq points out some fallacious arguments are not viewed as  fallacies in a court of law  ok granted  however you are using this reasoning as part of your logical argument in this discussion  this is not a court of law     if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then  i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one    were you not talking earlier about the bias of the liberal media conspiracy   the media is not totally monolithic  even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the macneillehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news  there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look  hurrah for rush  btw i never used the word conspiracy  i dont accept without far more evidence theories that there is some allpervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources   thou shalt not kill unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing   in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way   as unfortunately it cannot be helped                                    jim brown bible for loving christians    thanks mathew i like the quote  pretty funny actually  im a   monty python fan you know  kind of seems in that vein    of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem  contradictory  but then you know that already    ha ha only serious    i an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people    you a supposed christian are arguing that its ok to kill innocent people  so long as you get some guilty ones as well  hardly  i didnt say that its a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just  unfortunately we dont live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions  if one is going to  resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die  i didnt say it is ok  it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary     i a moral relativist am arguing that saturation bombing of german cities at  the end of world war ii was as far as i can see an evil and unnecessary act  i would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering  im not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say  that conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved and perhaps it was unnecessary as lets say we now know  that doesnt mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didnt see it as being necessary  rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision  at the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it  but dont assume that i feel the bombing was morally justified  i dont  i just dont condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances     you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that i am  in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the  war    you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist i as an absolutist am in a position to judge but i defer judgment   you are arguing that the actions need to be assessed in the particular  context of the time and that they might have been moral then but not moral  now  wrong  they were neither moral then nor now  they seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war  i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision    wheres your christian love  wheres your absolute morality  oh how quick  you are to discard them when it suits you  as ivan stang would say jesus  would puke  one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum  i understand the full ramifications of that and i am prepared to do so  i dont believe that you can make the same claim     mathew  and btw the reason i brought up the blanketbombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being  so deplorable  yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasnt accurate enough to hit industrialmilitary targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time  but in the gulf war precision bombing was the norm  so the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww2  even with precision bombing mistakes happen and some civilians suffer  but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history  many iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids  the stories of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk yes bunk  the us lost 230000 servicemen in ww2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting  but  we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of  civilian iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months  and with  the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that   what hogwash  if hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians died  it was due to actions hussein took on his own people not due to  the allied bombing  regards  jim b   ,0

1993apr1413015028931lynxdacnortheasternedu 79615cupportalcom   1qn5rnq7pcsugradcsvtedu lines 144  930418  do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law honestly the word of sin is restriction would i kid you   does one mans words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals  quoting a man is not the same as quoting the order  taken out of context words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression  i think this is the case regarding hymenaeus beta frater superior  of the order to which i belong  when he included that bit from merlinus x he did us all a service  he showed us the extremes to which order members have been known to go in their fervor i have little knowledge regarding reuss background but surely he was an unusual man and he was an important force in the order  for many years  yet as people change so do orders change and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of oto remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual  i hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the order itself perhaps by testing the limits myself   let us examine this issue a bit more closely  in 1895 karl kellner 18501905 a wealthy austrian industrialist and paper chemist as well as a highgrade mason founded the ordo templi orientis  kellner had traveled widely in the east where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices   kellners efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franz hartmann heinrich klein and theodore reuss who had worked together prior to joining the oto  the order was first proclaimed in 1902 in reusss masonic publication oriflamme  on kellners death reuss succeeded him as outer head oho  the jubilee edition of the oriflamme published in 1912 announced that the order taught secret of sexual magic   theodore reuss was an interesting character  born june 28 1855 in augsburg he entered masonry in 1876  he was a singer journalist and possibly a spy for the prussian political police infiltrating the socialist league founded by karl marxs daughter and her husband  reuss was later associated with william wynn westcott a leader of the golden dawn who later introduced him to john yarker  yarker chartered reuss to found the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany  after several attempts to concretize various masonic rites reuss settled on the development of the oto  the order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss leadership for example he chartered papus in france rudolph steiner in berlin and h spencer lewis in the usa  in 1912 the historic meeting between reuss and crowley occurred  crowley wrote that reuss came to him and accused him of revealing order secrets  when crowley looked at it afresh the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time  reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of all the english speaking world and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the equinox  reuss resigned as outer head of the order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named crowley his successor  all was well until 1925 when the book of the law was translated into german  there was a break in the continuity of the order  manyk members split with the new oho over the book which crowley was actively promulgating through the order he had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reusss request deeply infusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation  an introduction to the history of the oto by ad veritatem ix  within equinox iii10 edited by    hymenaeus beta frater superior rex summus sanctissimus     caliph of the united states of america       published by samuel weiser 1990    there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included this material in equinox iii10  and this is the real point is it not why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization  does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of thelema  or is he exercising his true will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers  a picture which leaves room for very many interpretations  it is quite easy for me to see for example that all of oto derived out of the dribble of faltering masonry purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them  and i can take that all the way down to our present caliph whose feeble support of the law of thelema is laughable at best  would i be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way   will i   i think not why  because my frater will see it as a perspective an interjection i am using as an example  my illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first  so it may be with oto and merlinus x  please look oto more carefully i do not support reusss words myself as i am not qualified to assess them and i am critical of their pomposity  if i who am a member of the order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so then what can this say about the health of the order  does it mean that the order has gone soft and abandoned its moral principles  or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own not shackled by some dogmatic requirement  how shall we resolve these two possibilities   i find a high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientis they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information  they are quite often artists and geniuses   having met some 20 longstanding members in the sf bay area many who are or were very heavily involved with the order i can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands  i have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta  in these moments  i followed my intuition and ive found little to stop me from requesting a second initiation from a different oto body  im happily participating in social groups feasts or initiations and have come to know the gnostic mass well enough for my tastes    this doesnt make me an authority on order politics and explanations however i can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand based on my limited contact with other members  i urge you not to take the words of merlinus x too far  there are many ways to interpret words and many people who have become involved with the order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision  i welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread   invoke me under my stars  love is the law love under will  i am i  frater i nigris dclxvi cccxxxiii ,3

institute lines 250    new in this version  challenge 5 plus an addendum summarizing charleys responses todate    this is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage  charley wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently   specious claims  ill continue to repost periodically until  he answers them publicly indicates that he wont answer them  stops posting to altatheism the altatheism community tells  me to stop or i get totally bored  i apologize for the   somewhat juvenile nature of this approach but im at a loss  to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and   seeming intellectual dishonesty   this is repost 3   charley  i cant help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts  i submit that you dont answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic and i once again challenge you to prove me wrong  to make the task as easy for you as possible ill present concise restatements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see  should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period i will repost this article with suitable additions and deletions at such time that i notice a post by you on another topic  i will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup  i would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice  if you can be kind enough to repost or email such articles i will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it from this list  now to the questions  1 after claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed then semiretracting that claim by stating that you werent referring to all atheists i asked you to name some atheists who you feel dont fit your patterns to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of  you failed to do so  please do so now  question can you name any aa posters who do not fit into your stereotype  here is the context for the question   this is not true for everyone on this board and you are out of line  in assuming that it is  you however deleted the text further along where i said that i didnt mean to imply that everybodys experience was along the same lines    whether or not you mean to make such implications you do so repeatedly    allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name those atheists that youve come across who do not fit into the patterns that you theorize   2 you have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and reason are all we have to go by and when pressed you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation  i have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason  you failed to do so  please do so now  question can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning  here is the context for the question  revelation is not reason and if we do have revelation then reasoning is not all we have  first show me that revelation exists  second if revelation is not perceived through the senses how exactly is it perceived  according to my websters revelation is an act of revealing or communicating divine truth  now tell me how such a thing can be revealed communicated other than via the senses  tell me how you can interpret this revelation other than with reason that is using your brain to interpret what you are sensing  when i say there is no way for a human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as interpreted by reason your brain it is because this is the simple truth  if you have another mechanism of interface by all means share it with us  then later  you cannot escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is our senses and our reason period  again this is indefensible    no it is simple truth  i challenge you to show me otherwise  then later  few mystics will agree to this assertion and the common defense of redefining senses to absorb for instance mystical experiences is begs the question of whether some senses are better than others  i allow you the broadest definition of senses to make things easier for you  now show me that mystical experiences exist  remember you arent allowed to go by testimony of others eg mystics since you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable  you know tainted by my own bias  further once these mystical thingies are absorbed show me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of interpretation via that persons reasoning capabilities  i challenge you to show me these things  if you cannot do so you might as well give up the fight  then later  let me reiterate you have not explained your interpretation of your experiences so it is not possible for me to have attacked them  in point of fact i specifically challenged you to explain this revelation stuff that you were talking about and i note for the record that you appear to have declined my challenge  what is it  how is it sensed  how is it interpreted  and how does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit of our senses and reasoning abilities  you have answered none of these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims  if you cant answer them your claims are entirely specious   3  you have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by aa posters are unverifiable and fantastical  i asked you to identify one such claim that i have made  you have failed to do so  please do so now  question have i made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical  if so please repeat them  here is the context for the question   i must thank david wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong  posting    then later  likewise the reference to unverifiable fantastical claims represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group  give me your address and ill be pleased to send you a dictionary failing that can you name one claim that i have made that is in any sense unverifiable or fantastical  i demand that you retract this statement if you cannot offer up evidence  if you follow your usual pattern of ignoring the challenge then you are simply an asshole   4  first you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason then later you stated that if one accepted the axioms of reason that one couldnt help but become atheist  i asked you to explain the contradiction  your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent an opinion not shared by others that i have asked be they atheist or theist  you have failed to answer the question  please do so now  question do you retract your claim that aa posters have not become atheists as a result of reason despite their testimony to that effect  if you dont retract that claim do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism  here is the context for the question  first quote we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is based on reason it is up to atheists to prove it to me  then  second quote but i do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with an atheistic point of view   5  first you claimed that you would probably not answer these challenges because they contained too much in the way of included text from previous posts  later you implied that you wouldnt respond because i was putting words in your mouth  please clarify this seeming contradiction  question  do you prefer to respond to challenges that include context from your own posts or that i paraphrase your positions in order to avoid included text  here is the context for the question  first you said  my ordinary rules are that i dont read articles over over 150 lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen  these are not rules of morality but practicality  then later  if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they cannot be argued with   as usual your responses are awaited with anticipation  dave wood   ps for the record below is a compilation of charleys responses to these challenges to date  31893 this makes no sense to me at all it gives the appearance either of utter incoherence or of answering some question of mr woods imagination  33193 1 mr wood i do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet thrown down on the net requires any response whatsoever  at some point i might read and respond to your article and then again i might not  my ordinary rules are that i dont read articles over over 150 lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen  these are not rules of morality but practicality  33193

1042,1042,from kempmpphoenixoulufi petri pihko subject re is morality constant was re biblical rape organization university of oulu finland xnewsreader tin version 11 pl6 lines 187  bill conner bilokcforumosrheedu wrote    there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread  that are a little confusing an atheist is one for whom all things can  be understood as processes of nature  exclusively  this definition does not include all atheists see the faq however i for one do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations   it makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter humans are not omnipotent and neither is science however science has one advantage theology doesnt it is self correcting with nature as its judge   it is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self consistent simple picture of our universe science is no longer a bunch of separate branches it is one from particle physics to psychology and no aspect of our life or our universe is safe from its stern and stony eye not even our consciousness   there is no need  for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there is  no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by  physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is  determnined  actually determinism vs indeterminism is a philosophical question and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not i think the question does not have any meaning as far as individual human beings go if their apparent free will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from their perspective bill can you say for sure whether you have a free will or not    this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all  its products there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it  acquire intelligence its just a happy accident  maybe who are we to tell it seems intelligence is useful  when during the history of earth has one species been able to control one third of the whole biosphere this can still be a result of  numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves even that machinery can be result of the same principle  only the systems that can start replicating will survive those which dont dont make it recommended reading to   for an atheist no  event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less  value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about  an event can have value   from whose perspective i value events and things subjectively from my perspective nature does not have values because it does not have a perspective  values arise from awareness if i have a subjective perspective it is easy to assume that other people also do and if i think about what it would it be like in their position i will eventually discover the golden rule morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens in fact it may be a product of evolution perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity too   bill have you ever read aristotle try his ethica nikomakhea sp for starters   how then can an atheist judge value what is the basis for criticizing  the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god on  what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned it  seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you  have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what  in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to  establish your values  cs lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became christian the argument is severely flawed  some values such as the golden rule can have a rational basis some others like the basic idea of wanting to live has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour and morality as well indeed as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools they also became better at killing each other it is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools but not against ones own people  the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early jews was not beyond this a simple set of rules to hold the people together under one god their god did not care much about people of other nations   at the time of the nt things were quite different  the jews were under rule of an empire and could no longer simply ignore the gentiles a new situation required a new morality and along with it a new religion was born a mutation in a meme pool   since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what  difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or  otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value the only  way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the  objection is entirely subjective and that heshe just doesnt like it   thats it any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer  that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries  no weight in any absolute sense  it looks like you havent bothered to read philosophy whenever there is an observer there is a subjective point of view which may  value its existence and happiness even if that were just a result of some physical event and others happiness too if the observer comes to think about it in an absolutely objective sense that is without any observers or subjects moral judgments lose their meaning   it is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view this includes gods too their values are only their  personal judgments not absolute truths since such truths do not exist   the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others existence  morality is not property of humans alone  chimps dolphins and many other species show great care for each other dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning a good deed indeed    that you dont like what god told people to do says nothing about god  or gods commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your  nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled  with a preexisting thoughtset to form that reaction that your  objections seem well founded is due to the way youve been  conditioned there is no truth content the whole of your  intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality  the last statement does not logically follow in fact there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well and our senses can convey reliable information solipsism is still a logical possibility but not a very likely one  you are continuously mixing two different views the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view which does not exist any observer or thinker any personal being has its own point of view it does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not it does not cease to be subjective   from a nonobservers nonpoint of view values do not exist neither does pain or pleasure or beauty or love such things are  inherently subjective   once again if god wants wives to submit to their husbands or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or wants to punish us if we dont i disagree with his morals i do not think my morals come from any supreme being  to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought if god gave us morality to judge but i disagree with him it is not my fault he is free to replace my morals i cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with ones own and then to get mad at this   god must be schizophrenic   all of this being so you have excluded  yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil  etc and cannot participate your opinion about the bible can have no  weight whatsoever  neither can the opinion of any god for that matter i cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else  bill take note absolute values must be independent of any being including gods if god has a subjective viewpoint it is his own point of view and his morals are his own   petri             petri pihko    kempmp          mathematics is the truth        pihatie 15 c    finououlufi    physics is the rule of               sf90650 oulu  kempmp           the

i3150101dbstu1rztubsde benedikt rosenau writes  in article 1993apr509125811830monu6ccmonasheduau dariceyoyoccmonasheduau fred rice writes   deletion of course people say what they think to be the religion and that this is not exactly the same coming from different people within the religion  there is nothing with there existing different perspectives within the religion  perhaps one can say that they tend to converge on the truth  my point is that they are doing a lot of harm on the way in the meantime  and that they converge is counterfactual religions appear to split and diverge even when there might be a true religion at the core the layers above determine what happens in practise and they are quite inhumane usually    what you post then is supposed to be an answer but i dont see what is has got to do with what i say   i will repeat it religions as are harm people and religions dont converge they split giving more to disagree upon and there is a lot of disagreement to whom one should be tolerant or if one should be tolerant at all  ideologies also split giving more to disagree upon and may also lead to intolerance  so do you also oppose all ideologies  i dont think your argument is an argument against religion at all but just points out the weaknesses of human nature  big deletion 2 do women have souls in islam  people have said here that some muslims say that women do not have souls  i must admit i have never heard of such a view being held by muslims of any era  i have heard of some christians of some eras holding this viewpoint but not muslims  are you sure you might not be confusing christian history with islamic history   yes it is supposed to have been a predominant view in the turkish caliphate  i would like a reference if you have got one for this is news to me  anyhow that women are the spiritual equals of men can be clearly shown from many verses of the quran  for example the quran says  for muslim men and women  for believing men and women for devout men and women for true men and women for men and women who are patient and constant for men and women who humble themselves for men and women who give in charity for men and women who fast and deny themselves for men and women who guard their chastity and for men and women who engage much in gods praise  for them has god prepared forgiveness and a great reward  quran 3335 abdullah yusuf alis translation  there are other quotes too but i think the above quote shows that men and women are spiritual equals and thus that women have souls just as men do very clearly    no it does not it implies that they have souls but it does not say they have souls and it is not given that the quote above is given a high priority in all interpretations  one must approach the quran with intelligence  any thinking approach to the quran cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals  i think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls  does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven  or to have a great reward understood to be in the afterlife  i think the usual answer would be no  in which case the part saying for them has god prepared forgiveness and a great reward says they have souls    if it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven then  i have no idea what a soul is  as for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations any thinking approach to the quran has to give all verses of the quran equal priority  that is because according to muslim belief the whole quran is the revelation of god  in fact denying the truth of any part of the quran is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in islam  quite similar to you other post even when the quran does not encourage slavery it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to slavery it is a non sequitur  look any approach to the quran must be done with intelligence and thought  it is in this fashion that one can try to understand the qurans message  in a book of finite length it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it but through its teachings it can guide you  i think however that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse and that since women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they must have souls from the above verse  lets try to understand what the quran is trying to teach rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage  the misinterpretations of the quran based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite but the interpretations  fully consistent are more limited  lets try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit for that is just showing how people can try to twist islam for their own ends  something i do not deny  but provides no reflection on the true teachings of islam whatsoever   fred rice  dariceyoyoccmonasheduau    ,0

the second volume in a trilogy that began with the coherence of theism 1977 and was concluded with faith and reason 1981  in this work swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of god  his arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western christian values and aesthetics to a god which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were decisively rejected in mackies the miracle of theism  in the revised edition of the existence of god swinburne includes an appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut mackie  j l mackie  the miracle of theism oxford this posthumous volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of god  it ranges from the classical philosophical positions of descartes anselm berkeley hume et al through the moral arguments of newman kant and sidgwick to the recent restatements of the classical theses by plantinga and swinburne  it also addresses those positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational such as those of kierkegaard kung and philips as well as replacements for god such as lelies axiarchism  the book is a delight to read  less formalistic and better written than martins works and refreshingly direct when compared with the handwaving of swinburne  james a haught  holy

 in article 734849678saturnwwcedu bissdasaturnwwcedu dan lawrence bissell writes 9first i want to start right out and say that im a christian  it  makes sense to be one  have any of you read tony campollos book liar  lunatic or the real thing  i might be a little off on the title but he  writes the book  anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity  in the process he became a christian himself  sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy  just what organization did he  belong to does it have a name  9the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a  modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was  logic alert  artificial trifercation  the are many other possible explainations  could have been that he never existed  there have been some good points made in this group that is not  impossible  that jc is an amalgam of a number of different myths mithra comes to mind  9some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows  who would  die for a lie  wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar  people  gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing  someone who was or had been healed  call me a fool but i believe he did  heal people     logic alert   argument from incredulity  just because it is hard for you to believe this doesnt mean that it isnt true  liars can be very pursuasive just look at koresh that you yourself site he has followers that dont think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die by not giving up after getting shot himself koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes  as far as healing goes  if i rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels  in one of them the healing that is done is not any more  that faith healers can pull off today  seems to me that the early gospels werent that compeling so the stories got bigger to appeal better  9niether was he a lunatic  would more than an entire nation be drawn  to someone who was crazy  very doubtful in fact rediculous  for example  anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see  this right away 9therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic he must have been the  real thing     or might not have existed or any number of things  that is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into  there are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible  once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives  however if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices  i have given at  least one valid alternative so the conclusion that jc is the real mccoy just because he isnt one of the other two alternative is no longer valid  9some other things to note  he fulfilled loads of prophecies in  the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone  this in his betrayal  and crucifixion  i dont have my bible with me at this moment next time i  write i will use it  jc was a rabbi  he knew what those prophecies were  it wouldnt be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy  what would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies and jc had absolutely no knowledge of then  yet  fullfilled them anyway  9i dont think most people understand what a christian is  it  is certainly not what i see a lot in churches  rather i think it  should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for gods  sake  he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  same  hey we cant do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives  over to him  thats tuff and most people dont want to do it to be a  real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at  but  just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes  time  we dont rush it in one day christianity is your whole life   it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in  a while  we box everything into time units  such as work at this  time sports tv social life  god is above these boxes and should be  carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ourselves    here i agree with you  anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says  seriously and what it says is that it must be a total way of life  i have very little respect for  xians that dont  if the myth is true then it is true in its entirity  the picking and choosing that i see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth  jim9          james l felder999 sverdrup technologyinc9     phone 2168914019

1132,1132,from dariceyoyoccmonasheduau fred rice subject re why is sex only allowed in marriage rationality was islamic marriage organization monash university melb australia lines 115  in 1993apr409390420517proximaaltza lucioproximaaltza lucio de re writes  dariceyoyoccmonasheduau fred rice writes  my point of view is that the argument all sexism is bad just simply does not hold  let me give you an example  how about permitting a woman to temporarily leave her job due to pregnancy  should that be allowed  it happens to be sexist as it gives a particular right only to women  nevertheless despite the fact that it is sexist i completely  support such a law because i think it is just  fred youre exasperating  sexism like racialism is a form of discrimination using obvious physical or cultural differences to deny one portion of the population the same rights as another  in this context your example above holds no water whatsoever theres no discrimination in denying men maternity leave in fact im quite convinced that were anyone to experiment with male pregnancy it would be possible for such a future father to take leave on medical grounds  okay i argued this thoroughly about 34 weeks ago  men and women are different  physically physiologically and psychologically  much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book brainsex by anne moir and david jessel  i recommend you find a copy and read it their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced   now if women and men are different in some ways the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different  maternity leave is an example of this  it takes into account that women get pregnant  it does not give women the same rules it would give to men because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust  this is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different  now people make the naive argument that sexism  oppression however maternity leave is sexist because men do not get pregnant  men do not have the same access to leave that women do not to the same extent or degree and therefore it is sexist  no matter however much a man wants to get pregnant and have maternity leave he never can  and therefore the law is sexist  no man can have access to maternity leave no matter how hard he tries to get pregnant  i hope this is clear  maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just because the sexism here just reflects the sexism of nature in making men and women different  there are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these i recommend you have a look at the book brainsex  your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious if men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women  to have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is  so your argument when it is examined is seen to be fallacious  you are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that  women can have if they also become women  which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist  the discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities because of her legally determined sexual inferiorities  as i understand most religious sexual discrimination and i doubt that islam is exceptional the female is not allowed into the priestly caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to rights which as an equal human she ought to be entitled to  there is no official priesthood in islam  much of this function is taken by islamic scholars  there are female islamic scholars and female islamic scholars have always existed in islam  an example from early islamic history is the prophets widow aisha who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an islamic scholar  no matter how sweetly you coat it part of the role of religions seems historically to have served the function of oppressing the female whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where there is no opportunity for selfimprovement or by denying her access to the same facilities the males are offered  you have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions and i dispute it  i could go on and on about women in islam etc but i recently reposted something here under the heading islam and women  if it is still at your newssite i suggest you read it  it is reposted from socreligionislam so if it has disappeared from altatheism it still might be in socreligionislam i forgot what its original title was though  i will email it to you if you like   the roman catholic church is the most blatant of the culprit because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy but the other religious are no different let a woman attempt to escape her role as child bearer and the wrath of god descends on her  your statement that other religions are no different is i think a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than christianity and perhaps judaism  ill accept your affirmation that islam grants women the same rights as men when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the same position as say khomeini and there are no artificial religious or social obstacles on her path to achieve this  aisha who i mentioned earlier was not only an islamic scholar but also was at one stage a military leader  show me the equivalent of hillary rhodamclinton within islam and i may consider discussing the issue with you  the prophets first wife who died just before the hijra the prophets journey from mecca to medina was a successful businesswoman  lucio you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions   fred rice  dariceyoyoccmonasheduau    ,0

93109231733isscckbyuvmbitnet casper c knies isscckbyuvmb gedaliah friedenberg friedenbmapleegrmsuedu writes as a latterday saint i found johns statement not at all ludicrous  please allow me to explain myself  in 1838 the governor of missouri governor boggs issued his socalled mormon extermination order  the only crime illegal activity the latterday saints had committed was their religious affiliation their antislave stance missouri still allowed slave practices and their growing numbersinfluence in missouri  i guess the mormons got what they deserved because they refused to bow to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities this disobedience brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from their lands and settlements  it is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by average people and that at the time almost all americans were pretty homogeonously christian it was largely the mainstream christians disgust at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred  true but that is exactly the problem the mormon extermination order was issued not just by a christian it was allowed under the constitution of the united states which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this order from occurring in the first place  as i indicated in an earlier posting your irrational hatred is clearly evidenced by individuals like robert weiss who could have been gov boggs lieutenant he would have fitted right in drewling et al and seems a modernday occurrence based on results slander persecution misrepresentation lies denying mormons representation in their own user group etc etc  in intent and purpose what really has changed  the situation is not entirely different today  many irrational feelings and beliefs are justified through religion  i dont think most of them are started because of religion but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages critical thought  true as evidenced by numerous examples as i am sure youre aware  in any regard mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities and i dont even discuss how uthans were suckered into allowing part of their lands in becoming nervegas and atomic bomb testing grounds is far from being trusted or righteous  have things really changed for the better  i may be a born cynic but i have no reason whatsoever that such has been the case in the early 1980s i believe the late president kimball lds church leader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the mxpeace keeper missile maze from being built in utah yet another inspired decision from secular authorities  fortunately his opposition was influential enough for the feds to back off  do you mean that the secular authorities are some continuous group of people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassingeradicating the mormons  do you honestly believe that the main reason for using utah for nuclear testing etc was to get them thar mormons  and what about the majority of uthans who arent mormons  you seem to be searching for enemy   correction the majority of utahns are mormon 6070 i believe up to a  100 in many cities and settlements throughout the western states  conspiracies  it is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly must have been done primarily for that purpose  what i mean is that secular authorities are to be watched as we believe that satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth judgment and justice  in addition we believe that the adversary has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous greed for money would be a good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression and evil combinations  as an intelligent being dont you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power  as far as utah is concerned what i pointed out were some horrible examples of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities which have brought death disease ie the downwinders and environmental contami nation  i am hardly paranoid i am just not expecting too much from a secular government that may not share our values and faith and which indeed as gov boggs et al may be out to harm and destroy us  as a matter of fact prophecies in my church indicate that in future years global persecution against mormons will so increase in intensity and scope that paraphrasing all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to zion  zion the pure in heart will be reestablished in those days and it aint our current secular authorities who will rule over it    david koresh did not pose a great threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and with john i too wonder who or whats next  i personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the life of even one person  sure he did not pose a threat to the security of this nation  but he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers  that much is definite  hmmm  definite by whom  until such has been established beyond reason able doubt this alleged threat may have been less than the threat imposed upon him and his followers by the batf and fbi  who killed who  what constitutional right did the atf officers have to invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound what really caused the murder of the little children  could it be that the atffbi presence has any bearing upon the events  how would you interpret the mt masada events  blame the jews  what the heck did the romans do there anyway  what business did the atffbi has in waco texas  the branch davidians never posed any threat to society  this is like asking who really caused the deaths of the israeli olympic team in 1976  in that case the police botched the job as well  but to lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake  i think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case certainly if david koresh chose any peaceful option the atf and fbi would have complied  the responsibility is more his than the authorities  come now at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise peaceful standoff lets get it over with and force david koresh to come out  by gassing them  were they naive or what  they played right into the hands of an apocalypticthinking individual he had prepared his people for this eventuality for years and not one firetruck or plan was in place to deal with this scenario  i feel that the authorities had some responsibility to protect their own citizens even if they were religious zealots and guilty of  not paying a 200 gun license has the batf become an extension of the local taxcollectors  david koresh no doubt will be described as the evil guy by the executioners while the actions of all those valiant and brave officers  characterizing the atffbi as executioners is inaccurate and unfair  in order to be an executioner the least one must have done is have the intent to kill  que intrusion into private property with semis loaded with life ammunition isnt that implicit intent or at least prepared to kill i ask you would the batf warrant stand up in a civil court of justice i do not mind if criminals such as dangerous drug lords are brought to justice but escalating events to the point of allowing to if not compli city with the destruction of a people   isaac kuo isaackuomathberkeleyedu                            how lucky you

you well point out stephen   9anyone batf bd xbd other could have touched it off 9by mistake or maliciously  9more on this below   9once koresh was shot disregarding his being a religious 9leader and apocalyptically obsessed most likely the people 9inside just went on drill just like the batf outside  is the lesson that automatic responses are very hazardous last resort  measures  9yes  but it is so hard toremain human under the full 9pressure of hazard game playing and life    painful point 2  9either side could have backed off to help defuse the 9situation  we see the problem constantly here on the 9net with flaming    ego problems  nuff said   9more to the point  when someone dies almost like it was intended 9that way both sides will kill to maintain their innocence  99a contradiction in terms    painful point 3  9it doesnt help to take sides in such a situation just 9adds fuel to the fire better is to let it burn out on 9its own   9true  usually i pick the unpopular side and point out 9from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened   best example i can think of is christ with the tax coin he didnt  have one and so didnt sanction the roman authority unduly when  they showed it to him he noted that it was caesars minting and so said give it to him no waste of time and then he got back to more worthwhile concerns  gods will   9this requires someone interested in gods will  please note 9that the outstanding overt problem in this country today 9is one where the government  99wants caesars coin to pay off the debt   the antitax movement of today and the antissanasid groups would do well to note who the issuing authority is ditto for those  9yes  the american people  not the federal government 9and if it is not spent towards that end noone deserves 9the coin   made in the image of god  9yah  fewpeople hear the contradiction  99money 99made 99in the image 99of god   no need to stir things up in ever larger revorevorevolution as governments turn over and over and over   9i wish you were wrong  many pundits are saying 3 years 9the onyl good thing to come out of my divorce and my 9exposure to the damned pardon me american divorce attorney 9is  99i have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation    painful point 4  9for many this was just entertainment  9 9thumbsup thumbsdown   9just another thriller like terminator 2 9or a goodold ball game  is the lesson that weve become jaded to media reality  925 children dead  if anyone thinks blaming koresh  or the batf 9helps this any at all is sick  and wrong  99the reason you can tell that the batf may not be entirely 99straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences 99havew made any comments about even the possibility that 99koresh or his followers caused this  99the batf agentss are more concerned with their repuations 99and morals not my fault koresh did it than they 99are with  99925 dead children  9same goes for koresh  his followers  who are all mostly dead     painful point 5         9la burned the davidians burned in one case society has 9abandoned the people  which has returned to a frontier 9in the other  the outskirts were bumping against the 9suburbs   is the lesson that whats lawful in different areas of society depends more on conditions than laws  9more on power and favoritism  my personal opinion  9look to history  whenever privilege has replaced whatever 9token of objective law and justice a society has had  99hitlerrs have followed    if we dont learnthelessons or at least make an honest effort the next conflagration will no doubt be closer to home   rather than putting out fires arent there much more important concerns for us to work on  9you do your name sake proud stephen 9its hard but please keep on keeping on 99each voice in the wilderness now will 99save a generation unborn from horror   kent who cant cheers today exactly  what keeps me from being a bombthrower is my loving god as irra tional as that is for so many one direct benefit is being able to  keep things in perspective ks  9the day i need a gun or abomb to protect myself in this 9society is the day that society is already beyond redemption  99and that aint redundant if you have any christian 99belief aytall  9 and the day that i cannot peacefully enjoin others in the 9act that thoreau called civil disobedience to rectify the 9wrongs that my society practises without undue harm or 9punishment befalling me is the day that society has ceased to 9be a human society and become a society of animals  99we are very cclose to that   such as who hurts more  the ones who died or the loved ones who  are left besides the lessons its also time for many to grieve including those whove lost their faith in others or in god  im learning to be patient and let things heal god willing  9six years fighting an unjust court issue  still struggling to be 9patient  for those who like contrary questions  9nb  i was not there  i am not a branch davidian nor a     law 9official hater  i do hate liars or the six letter variety of same 9the official side has its advocates already lets balance the 9equation and asj a few questions on the other side for the sake 9of an old saw the batf abd fbi seem to want to bypass  99innocent until proven guilty 9not 99innocent until presumed guilty  91  where are the video tapes from the tanks  all of them  99dont tell me they do not exist  they are standard 99equipment  92  so you think koresh fired the place because of the explosion  99a  tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it  this 99  aerosol is deliberately made to be as nonflammable 99  as possible  it is as nonflammable as possible  999 gotcha  99   when in isolation from other substances  99  why was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote 99  launchers  why did the fbi not announce this window 99  blown in plus tear gas five minutes then the wall come 99  down and maintain a left to right sequence  99b  most aerosols also have a secondary

article 1993apr1021354717644ramboatlantadgcom wpratlantadgcom bill rawlins writes    earlier dialogue deleted     perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the bible as evidence relating    to questions of science      it  did jesus exist by g a wells         there is a great fallacy in your statement the question of origins is       based on more than science alone      nope no fallacy  yep science is best in determining how religions handle  why and who          the problem is that most scientists exclude the possibility of the         supernatural in the question of origins  is this is a fair premise  not entirely  its not a premise its a conclusion  second that scientists for the most part exlude the possibility is not a problem its a necessity  scientists are empircists not theologians          i utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of         truth  so do scientists and long before you did  clearly you have a deep and  fundamental misunderstanding of science          if you met a man who could walk on       water raise people from the dead claimed to be the son of god and       then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures this would affect       your belief in the origin of man  i can expand on this      nope wouldnt affect my knowledge not belief of origins of anatomically  modern humans  if that man could show me something better id change even if   it was the biblical story in exact detail  but then i would ask why in the  world did your father endow us with intellect and reason and then proceed to  fool us  i mean the bible says nothing about the humanlike creatures that we  know exist          some of these socalled humanlike creatures were apes  some were         humans  some were fancifully reconstructed from fragments  absolutely and utterly false except for some were amhs lucy australopithecus afarensis ca 3 to 325 mya is 40 complete and about 80 taking into  consideration bilateral symmetry  lucy walked upright and bipedally just  like humans and the two share a remarkably similar dental pattern  her cranial morphology is unlike humans or modern apes  there are hundreds of  other specimens of this and other species of which only some are partially  reconstructed  they exist bill  you can touch them feel them hold them   but forget hominids  the earth the universe the cultural record all look and  test out as ancient indeed  they are not reconstructions  has god has tricked us here too  it wont go away bill         i doubt any of us will meet a man like this  but bill if your version of all  this is absolutely correct im still no worried about my salvation  ill  probaby make it i dont steal murder covet etc and i like to help other  people  all i did was use the reason and intellect your god provided   he or she  benevolent and loving  will understand my dilemma dont you  think             good deeds do not justify a person in gods sight            an atonement jesus is needed to atone for sin  so you and other fundamentalists say  what about the billions who dont  say so  beware of people who say they have the truth bill and reconsider each time you think you do       science and    the bible are not in contradiction  god can supercede the scientific    laws as man understands them  creation is a good example  god has the    power to create something out of nothing order out of chaos    havent been on to long but i have a feeling bill that the veterans will  agree with you here  no contradiciton and god can do anything at will  so  whats the beef or more properly wheres       my point god is the creator  looks like we agree  that was not your point bill  your point above was god has the power  scientists generally agree with that  thats a far cry from saying god did please attempt to understand your own posts          if the title of the book you mentioned has anything to do with the       substance of the book it must be a real laugher  of course jesus existed      and there are volumes of evidence to back it up  i can give many if you      are interested    its not a laugher bill  its a scholarly book that many happen to disagree  with  i am definitely and seriously interested in confirmation  i know of  the bible inferences therefrom eg prophecies apocrypha the koran and  others  what i am interested is independent evidence  do you have any  i  know of josephus but this is almost certainly an insertion  also i know of a  few roman documents eg pliny but these deal only with early christians  do you have any independent evidence  i am most interested  please email or   post  thanks and best regards       ill send you some info via email      regards bill  i have your info and i have replied

867info 8674636 at kennedy space center      official nasa shuttle status reports are posted to scispacenews     frequently       why does the shuttle roll just after liftoff      the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks     kjenksgothamcityjscnasagov      the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc gc 2102     says  9during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is 9commanded until an iloaded vrel sufficient to assure launch tower 9clearance is achieved then the tilt maneuver roll program 9orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a 9negative qalpha which in turn alleviates structural loading other 9advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort 9maneuver complexity improved sband look angles and crew view of 9the horizon the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining 9downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target 9in second stage      this really is a good answer but its couched in nasa jargon ill try     to interpret      19we wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling      29then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack 9between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the 9relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line 9between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly 9negative angle a negative qalpha9this causes a little bit of 9downward force toward the belly of the orbiter or the z 9direction and this force alleviates structural loading 9we have to be careful about those wings  theyre about the 9most delicate part of the vehicle      39the new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more 9mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or 9to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be 9the case if we didnt roll performance gain      49the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated 9flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort 9maneuvers the return to launch site decreased abort maneuver 9complexity      59the new attitude improves the ability for groundbased radio 9antennae to have a good lineofsight signal with the sband radio 9antennae on the orbiter improved sband look angles      69the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a 9helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine      79the new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is 9more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east 9usually  this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity 9in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit  remember 9velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction 9the shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its 9velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit      this all begs the question why isnt the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with  why does the shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude  the answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the apollo days  the shuttle straddles two flame trenches  one     for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main     engine exhaust  you can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch  the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust is     fluffy white steam  watch for the difference between the top     orbiter side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the saturn vs  a side note the     saturn vs also had a roll program  dont ask me why  im a shuttle     guy      i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics9he added that the roll     maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw     the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated  the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack qalpha within a tight tolerance  the yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination  the total     maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a gradlevelmath     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one fourelement     array       how to receive the nasa tv channel nasa select      nasa select is broadcast by

version 11 pl8  malcolm lee mleepostroyalroadsca wrote  i will clarify my earlier quote  gods laws were originally written for   the israelites  jesus changed that fact by now making the law applicable to  all people not just the jews  gentiles could be part of the kingdom of  heaven through the saving grace of god  i never said that the law was made  obsolete by jesus  just for reference heres the earlier quote malcolm lee mleepostroyalroadsca wrote in reference to leviticus 219 and deuteronomy 222025  these laws written for the israelites gods chosen people whom god had  expressly set apart from the rest of the world  the israelites were a  direct witness to gods existence  to disobey god after knowing that god  is real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately  punishable  remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to  gods chosen people  but jesus has changed all of that  we are living in  the age of grace  sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  there  is repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ  and  not just for a few chosen people  salvation is available to everyone jew  and gentile alike  these are two conflicting statements  to say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic  i dont mind people shifting their position on an issue  it irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made  what about deuteronomy 222025  is it wrong now  did jesus change that   if anything he clarified the law such as in that quote you made  in the  following verses jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon  the law giving clearer meaning to what god intended  sure he does this  however he doesnt address the notion of stoning nonvirgin brides because this needs no clarification  are you going to deny that deuteronomy 222025 is not patently clear in its intent   i think you will agree with me that there are in todays world a lot of  modernday pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe  in it  what good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart  ill agree that there is a lot of modern day pharisees that know the bible from end to end and dont believe in it  depending on how they use this knowledge they can be scary  they can argue any position they desire and back it up with selected parts of the bible  such pharisees include david koresh and adolph hitler  i will qualify this by saying i dont know if they actually believed what they were preaching but the ends certainly made the means look frightening  however just as scary are those that dont know much of the bible but believe every word  in fact this is probably scarier since there are far more of these people from what ive seen  in addition they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned pharisees since they dont know enough to debate with these people   christianity is not just a set of rules its a lifestyle that changes ones  perspectives and personal conduct  and it demands obedience to gods will  no it demands obedience to a book  if god came down and personally told me how i should behave then i would say that i would be doing gods will by doing it  however if preachers pastors and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia even longer for the ot even if i follow everything in it with my heart i could scarcely be honest with myself by saying im doing the will of god   some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not  that is  their choice and i have to respect it because god respects it too  well if god respects it so much how come there is talk in the bible about eternal damnation for nonbelievers  i see little respect eminating from the god of the bible  i see a selfish and spiteful god   god be with you  not yours thanks    malcolm lee    rob lanphier lanphi872snakecsuidahoedu lanph872uidahoedu  and for the curious here is my earlier post  hmm for a book that only applied to the israelites deuteronomy jesus sure  quoted it a lot mt 4 4710  in addition he alludes to it in several  other places mt 1978 mk 1035 jn 54647  and just in case it isnt  clear jesus thought the old testament isnt obsolete ill repeat the  verse in matthew which gets quoted on this group a lot    do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have  not come to abolish them but to fulfill them  i tell you the truth until  heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke  of a pen will by any means disappear from the law until everything is  accomplished  anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments  and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of  heaven but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called  great in the kingdom of heaven  for i tell you that unless your  righteousness surpasses that of the pharisees and the teachers of the law  you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven  mt 51720 niv in  pretty red letters so that you know its jesus talking    this causes a serious dilemma for christians who

1386,1386,from bskendignetcomcom brian kendig subject is it good that jesus died organization starfleet headquarters san francisco lines 114  brianlplarizonaedu brian ceccarelli 6026219615 writes brian kendig writes  if you can explain to me why the death of jesus was a good thing then i would be very glad to hear it and you might even convert me be warned however that ive heard all the most common arguments before and they just dont convince me  ask jesus himself  he himself said why in john 122332  it isnt a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument   read jesuss own reply to your question  john 122426 most assuredly i say to you unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies it remains alone but if it dies it produces much grain   he who loves his life will lose it and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life   if anyone serves me let him follow me and where i am there my servant will be also  if anyone serves me him my father will honor  why would i want an eternal life if i hate this one  if we were created by a deity why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us  why would i want to live forever  the challenge in my life is that i will die and that i must give my life the meaning i wish it to have before that happens  my time is here and will someday pass i will be content to live on in the memories of my friends and once they too are dead then i will no longer have any reason to exist  in short even if your deity does exist that doesnt automatically mean that i would worship it  i am content to live my own life and fend for myself so when i die i can be proud of the fact that no matter where i end up it will be because of my actions and my choices  if your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this then so be it  i would much rather just cease to exist  but if your god wants my respect and my obedience then it had better earn these and if it does then they will be very strong and true  jesus gives more reasons in john 167  but one obvious reason why jesus died and as with everything else it has nothing do with his punishment was that he could rise to life againso that we would stop doubting and believe john 2127  the fact that jesus rose from the dead is my hope that i too will rise from the dead  it is an obvious point  do not overlook it without this obvious point i would have no hope and my faith would be vanity  jesus wasnt the only one who rose from the dead  i think it was osiris who did the same as well as a few characters from greek or norse legend if memory serves  but still why would i want to rise from the dead  why do you want to  why did jesus suffer in his death  again ask jesus  jesus says why in john 151825   thats no mystery either  the world hates him without reason  it is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus how much we need a saviour  if your god wants to win my devotion then it knows what it can do  provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion  and why cant you brian k accept this  how can you  the world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him  john 1417  thats precisely it  i neither see nor know zeus either nor odin shall i offer them the same devotion i offer jesus  the animosity and the lack of knowledge that comes out in your twistings of roberts daily verses is very convincing testimony of the truth of john 1417 and 1625  youve got to understand my pointofview i see christians spouting bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition  truth is its not  robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply he just rattles them off day by day  some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality and i point these out where i can  but even more than that even when christians do try to explain the verses in their own words they do so from a christian point of view which is that every human being would want to be a christian if only he or she understood the christian message properly and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end  heres the problem with that substitute moslem or buddhist or satanist instead of christian and it means the same thing  christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book  but if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the real world youve got some convincing to do  i pray and hope that i do blurt out such animosity and lack of knowledge i am not perfect either  but regardless of that i thank god that jesus revealed himself to me without whom id also be bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very person who created me and who loves me  and in my opinion youre bumbling about blindly making up entities where there arent any and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life  as long as you keep your beliefs to yourself ill keep my beliefs to myself  but as soon as you start waving them around expect me to toss in my opinions too     brian kendig

1411,1411,from davebpogowvtekcom dave butler subject re new biblical contradictions still not answered judas organization tektronix inc wilsonville  or lines 180  mr decenso in spite of requiring scholarly opinion on the hanging of judas rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases those scholars opinion on the subject   we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably records  his death  although its possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging  and hit some rocks thereby bursting open i can no longer assume that to be  the case  therefore no contradiction  matthew did not say judas died as a                                             result of the hanging did he  most scholars believe he iprobably did but      i quoted all that to show that i highly regard the scholars explanations but  in looking at the texts initially we cant assume judas died  it is   however highly probable                     and    also there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure  it simply  means hang oneself  actually if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw you will find that it does denote success  those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful  as i pointed out i recently checked several lexicons  9greek english lexicon of the new testament louw and nida 9robinsons greek and english lexicon of the new testament 9greek english lexicon of the new testament grimm 9word study concordance tynsdale 9a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other  9 early christian writings bauerarndtgingrich 9the new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher  a couple simply stated hanged oneself and a couple were more explicit  and stated that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hanging a couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for apacgw is strangle throttle or choke which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to david joslin that judas was hung upside down  one of the best references though robinsons greek and english lexicon of the new testament not only stated the translation it gave both the root words the literal translation related greek words which use the same roots and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature to give further context    the word apagchw has two root words gchw is the to strangle root and the root word apo means literally away this root words is included in words which denote a transition  it can mean a transition in place eg the greek word apagello means to send a message  apo can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death  robinson specifically makes comparison to the word apokteiuo which means to kill in literal meaning the word apacgw means to throttle strangle to put out of the way and implicitly denotes a change in life state ie away from life to death  so while the word apacgw does mean to hang it specifically denotes a death as well  thus robinson is quite specific when he state that it means to hang oneself to end ones life by hanging he then notes the the use of apacgw in homers odessy 19230 to denote context  he presents that example of apacgw as being used to explicitly mean suicide by hanging now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling without the added denotation of death and as you insist that the bible was written by god and every word is precicely correct you are stuck with the complete meaning of apacgw ie since the word apacgw was used then death is denoted as the result   by the way i note that mr decenso also presents an example of apacgw   in the septuagint the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesus  its only used in 2 samuel 1723  now when ahithophel saw that his advice   was not followed he saddled a donkey and arose and went home to his house  to his city then he put his household in order and hanged himself and   died and he was buried in his fathers tomb        notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel hanged himself gr sept  apagcho but it explicitly adds and died  here we have no doubt of the  result  in matthew we are not explicitly told judas died  note mr decenso as you say the septuagint was a translation from hebrew to greek and you have not shown the original meaning of the hebrew ie the the hebrew say and died and thus whether it was simply echoed in the greek  it should also be pointed out that regardless of the added and died the correct translation would still be apacgw as the man did indeed die from strangulation redundant but correct  further we have evidence that the septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited which included versions which contradicted each other and such editing was not even necessarily executed by greeks  thus i am not sure that you can use the septuagint as it now stands as a paragon of ancient greek  so what you really need to prove your point mr decenso is an example in ancient greek of someone committing apacgw and surviving  otherwise i would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence   now i would note mr decenso that everytime i go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis i pretty much find it false  thus i think that if you are going to add to the text something over and above what the source clearly says then you had better have an explicit greek or historical source to justify it   by the way as to mr roses statement about trees around the potters field   there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom  unless mr rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old or that there are 2000 year old stumps there or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago after all things change   now as to your other argument ie that the money judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers   as to your second question mr decenso you ask how we could be sure that the  money with which judas purchased the land was indeed for the betrayal rather  than some other source  i would point out that in acts where it specifically  mention the reward of iniquity acts 118 it also specifically mentions  what act of iniquity they were talking about ie acts 116 concerning  judas who was guide to those who arrested jesus  now i would point out  that when the bible describes an act of iniquity and then immediately  discusses the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that  it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed       notice that in verse 16 the word iniquity is not used  rather it states  that judas became a guide to those who arrested jesus  but the writer did not stop therevs 17 for he was numbered with us and  obtained a part in this ministry  what part did judas play in their ministry             true peter or the author of acts does not specifically call judas betrayal an iniquity but for that matter neither does john specifically call judas actions an iniquity either  further john 1329 did not say that judas took the money box but rather said      some thought that because judas had the money box jesus was telling      him buy what we need for the feast or that he should give something      to the poor so after receiving the morsel he immediately went out and      it was night  note that it is said that judas left it does not say that he took the money box  thus when i see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity mentioned by another author in a different book written at a different time over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts  i find this forced and contrived   of course this particular argument becomes moot since we have have seen evidence that apacgw means suicide  you see since judas hanging was successful he could not have spent the money mentioned in john 1329 because matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day ie passover and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day  thus the money which bought the field of blood would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well and thus couldnt have spent that either  oh dear i believe that the house of cards is comming down   maybe we should at this point discuss now whether jesus was crucified on friday or saturday as that is now part of the argument about judas  by the way as to where the prophesy of the potters field came from ie the mention of it in matthew you say   please when we are done with this study on his death remind me to discuss  this with you  i am reminding you now to discuss it now its all part of the same verse we are discussing and i wish you would quit

demands that i stop or i run out of good   material    i havent been particularly careful in the past about saving   attributions  i think the following comes from john a johnson   but someone correct me if im wrong  this is probably the longest   of my entire collection                                       so that the                                   prophecy be                                    fulfilled                                                  in considering the christian religion and judging it according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier jewish prophecy  the scribe matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of jesus of nazareth  as you will see matthews main strategy is to take various old testament passages often not even about the promised messiah and apply them to the circumstances in the new testament  we must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts  since the gospels were written at least 35 years after jesus was executed we do not know how much happened exactly as stated  but for purposes of analysis we will take particular claims at face value  immanuel         we begin of course at the beginning         mt 12122  mary will bear a son and you        joseph will name him jesus which means gd is        salvation for he will save his people from their        sins  all this happened to fulfil what the lord had        spoken by a prophet         isaiah 7116  in the days of ahaz c 750 bce        king of judah rezin of syria and pekah of israel made        war on jerusalem capitol of judah but could not        quite conquer it  when the house of david ie ahaz        and his court in judah were told of this its        heart and the heart of its people shook   and the        lord gd said to isaiah go to meet with ahaz         and the lord spoke to ahaz through prophet isaiah        naturally saying ask a sign of gd your lord  it        can be as deep as sheol or as high as heaven  but        ahaz said i wont ask i will not put the lord to a        test  then isaiah said hear then o house of        david  is it not enough for you to weary men that        you must weary my god too  therefore the lord        himself will give you a sign  behold a young woman        is with child and will bear a son and name him        immanuel which means gd is with us   he will        eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil        and choose good  for before the child knows how to        refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings        you dread will have been deserted  matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics  further he the hebrew word almah young woman as specifically virgin  but this is not a prophecy about the messiah  it is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later  it is not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother  in short it not about jesus  matthew has made use of a verse out of context and tries to make it fit the specific case of mary  it should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be made to fit mary  mary virgin or not was indeed a young woman with child  of course the fit is shady and has problems  jesus while thought of by later christians to be gd walking among men was never called by the name immanuel  if christianity wished to claim this prophecy for jesus it becomes at best a cutandpaste prophecy a second class prophecy   not too convincing  egypt         after jesuss birth in bethlehem matthew tells about a quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to egypt as if he wishes to liken jesus to moses  this was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king herod         mt 215  and remained there until the death of        herod  this was to fulfil what the lord had spoken        out of egypt i have called my son   what the lord really said was this         hosea 111  when israel was a child i loved him         and out of egypt i called my son  the more i called        them my people the more they went from me they        kept sacrificing to the baals and kept burning        incense to idols  matthew conveniently omits the rest of hoseas oracle  but it was indeed israel that once called out of egypt wanted to return  this is history  jesus is certainly not being spoken of here  and if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a jesus that flees and resists gd   again this prophecy is just not as convincing as matthew probably had hoped  rachel weeps          while jesus is off vacationing in egypt matthew says that king herod sought to kill him and thus ordered the executions of all young male children  matthew then writes         mt 21718   by this that which was spoken by the        prophet jeremiah was fulfilled         a voice was heard in ramah wailing and loud        lamentation rachel weeping for her children        she refused to be consoled because they were        no more     the reference is to a passage in jeremiah 3115 referring to the carrying off of israel into exile by sargon of assyria in 722 bce  rachel the ancestor of the major tribes of israel ephraim and manasseh is said to weep for her descendants who are no more  it is metaphorical of course since rachel lived and dies before the hebrews were even in the egyptian exile        it is interesting to note that it was leah not rachel who was the ancestor of the judeans the land where jesus and bethlehem were  if anyone should do weeping for her children it is leah  the only connexion that rachel has with bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city on the way to ephrath bethlehem        as for herod and his infanticide it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred  one never knows but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the bible nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time  herod was particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil deeds of herod were carefully recorded  this might be a prime example of how events were added to jesuss life to enhance the message of the churchs gospel        because of the whole storys similarity to the tale of the infant moses in egypt it is highly likely that it is a device set up by matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of jesus it is not surprising that matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the jeremiah quote   the children the prophet speaks of are not dead but exiled in the assyrian empire  gd comforts the weeping rachel saying that the children will be returned he will gather them back together  of course this would not suit matthews purpose as the children he speaks of are dead for good  again the prophecy matthew sets up is not even that and to anyone who bothers to check it out is not too convincing  the nazarene         we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another matthean prophecy  after leaving egypt joseph  wife take the infant jesus to live in the city of nazareth          mt 223  that what was spoken of by the prophets        might be fulfilled he shall be called a nazarene  first thing we notice is that matthew does not mention the name of the prophets this time  second we have to ask who he is  there are no messianic prophecies speaking of a nazarene  worse there are no prophecies period mentioning a nazarene  still worse there are no nazarenes mentioned in the old testament at all  in the book of judges an angel tells samsons mother that she will         judges 135  conceive and bear a son  no razor        shall tough his head for he will be a nazirite to his        god from the day of his birth  he will deliver israel        from the hands of the philistines  this is of course not a prophecy of jesus or the messiah of gd  but it is the best that can be found  obviously matthew has begun to go overboard in cutandpaste prophecies in that he is simple making them up now  bearing our diseases         jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities         mt 817   this was to fulfil what was spoken by the        prophet isaiah he took our infirmities and bore our        diseases  as expected the verse quoted in isaiah is quoted out of context and a few words are skewed to fit the christian scheme  we have         is 534  surely he the suffering servant has        borne our sickness and carried our pains  from a reading of the surrounding passages in isaiah we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of israel jehovahs chosen servant and people  he speaks to the israelites suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it  this image is deeply ingrained in jewish identity an image of a chastised yet cherished israel as the instrument of the nations salvation by gd       the verses speak of israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline  they do not speak of a servant going around and healing people  notice that the servant in isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations and individual jews  jesus as we all know did not take the diseases onto himself  the verses here in isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that had already happened  while it is believed that jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bear the illnesses he healed  so while someone might want to say that figuratively jesus reenacted the deeds of israel in his spiritual atonement he has to admit that matthews parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect   silent messiah        upon healing multitudes of commoners it is said that jesus ordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldnt arouse the attention of the local rulers         mt 121521  this was to fulfill what was spoken by        the prophet isaiah            behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved        with whom my soul is pleased  i will put my spirit on        him and he will announce justice to the gentiles  he        will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear        his voice in the streets  he will not break a bruised        reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings        justice to victory and the gentiles will hope in his        name  the isaiah passage quoted reads         is 4214  behold my servant whom i uphold my        chosen in whom my soul delights  i have put my        spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the        nations  we will not cry or lift up his voice or        make it heard in the street  he will not break a        bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick  he will        faithfully bring forth justice  he will not fail        burn dimly or be discouraged bruised until he has        established justice in the earth  and the coastlands        await his law  you see matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage because it does not suit the dealings of jesus  christians could never think of jesus failing never would the light of mankind burn dimly  but the servant nation of israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done  when the gentiles come to embrace gd there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will be the children of gd  also the ending phrase has been changed from the judaic the coastlands await his law to the christologic the gentiles will hope in his name   while the original proclaims the torah law of jehovah the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name  if one has any doubt the servant referred to is not jesus one has only to read the whole chapter isaiah 42 and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant a people robbed and plundered   so we see that when matthews attempt at prophecy is examined it crumbles  three days and three nights        now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god jesus himself  he speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection         mt 1240   for as jonah was in the belly of the        whale for three days and three nights so will the son        of man be in the heart of the earth three days and        three nights  before any further discussion can occur it is necessary to know how the jews understood days  as far as day names went each was 24 hours long lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm  what was referred to as a day was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm  thus according to our time scale a sabbath day began at 6pm friday evening and lasted until 6pm saturday evening  this is why the jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of saturdays instead of sundays  it seems like a real miracle that christians didnt forget that saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week  thus when days and nights are referred to together 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of  thus jesus says that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights        as the good book tells us jesus was crucified on the ninth hour which is 3pm friday afternoon  he then was put into the grave sometime after that  then jesus left the grave rose before dawn of what we call sunday the dawn after the sabbath was over  what this means is that jesus was using our time for clarity in the grave from 6pm friday night to some time before 6am sunday morning  we could also add a little time before 6pm friday since the bible is not specific here  what this means using jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day two nights and possibly a couple of hours of one day  certainly this is a problem for jesus prediction  there is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights even using modern time measurements   we then are led to suspect that this error is another one of matthews little mistakes and that the gospel writer put false words into his gods mouth   and no matter who made the prediction it is more than unconvincing it is counterconvincing  hearing  understanding       jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables stories in which a deeper meaning could be found if you were already one of the elect those chosen to understand the message of jesus  he reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants  if the people cannot understand them there is no need to bother with them since they will not accept the plain message any better  matthew says         mt 131416  with them the audience indeed in        fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which says          you will indeed hear but never understand and you        will indeed see but never perceive  because this        peoples heart has grown dull their ears are heavy of        hearing and they have shut their eyes so the they        would not perceive with them her with their ears and        understand with their heart and turn for me to heal        them  the original isaiah passages are part of his earlier works his call to the ministry  this is in 740 bce when israel is flourishing right before it falls under the authority of assyria  isaiah sees the good times ending and also a vision from gd calling him to bring reform to israel and judah         is 6913  and gd said go and say to this        people hear and hear but do not understand see and        see but do not perceive   make the heart of this        people fat make their ears heavy and shut their        eyes so they will not see with their eyes or hear        with their ears and understand with their hearts and        turn and be healed  then isaiah said how long        lord  and he said until the cities lie waste        without inhabitant and houses without men and the        land is utterly desolate and the gds take men far        away and forsaken places are many in the land  and        though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned        again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still        stands when the tree is felled the holy seed is its        stump  here we see that it is really gd who causes the people of israel to stop listening to the prophets warnings but reaffirms the promise made to solomons and davids seedlineage  if you read the rest of isaiah you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of gd to use israel as a servant a light to the nations  look at isaiah 421825 4820 493      we see that matthew has cutandpasted just a little portion of isaiahs verse to suit his own gospel needs  more than that he has altered the words to make it fit the people who didnt understand jesuss stories  and as we see isaiahs verses are not prophecies but rather commands from gd to him in the present   once again matthews prophecy falls flat on its face        matthew tries again to make jesuss parables look like they have the prophetic approval         mt 1335  he said nothing to them without a        parable  this was to fulfil what was spoken of by the        prophet i will open my mouth to them in parables  i        will utter that which has been hidden since the        foundation of the world  matthew really botches up here  he attempts to quote not from a prophet but from the psalms         ps 7824  i will open my mouth in parable  i will        utter dark sayings of old things that we all have        heard and known things that our fathers have told us         we will not hide them from their children but tell to        the coming generation the glorious deeds of the        lord  as was pointed out the verses in the psalms do not really come from a prophet  you might also want to know that earlier copies of matthews gospel even inserted isaiahs name as this prophet  apparently later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up      perhaps the most significant part of this is that once again matthew has altered the old testament scriptures  as jesus has said earlier he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them  the parables in the psalms are not to be hidden  further they speak of things known that our fathers have told us  jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of the world  indeed jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion  this is in direct opposition to the parables in the psalms  no wonder matthew had to rewrite them   and still once again matthews artificial prophecies fall flat on their face  but christians rarely look at this  matthews prophecies arent the only things about christianity that are beginning to look bad   excuses of little faith         in mt 171421 we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons except in one case  not knowing what epilepsy was the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons  it is no wonder that the disciples were unable to dispossess the epileptic  but jesus perhaps no more enlightened than they is reported to have rebuked them saying they didnt have enough faith   this seems strange  why was this demon special  it seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not  apparently enough faith will allow someone to move mountains  of course you will find no one these days that can move real mountains  no one parts seas  the only miracles the charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to mexico or some faraway place  major miracles are making some old womans arthritis feel better on sunday morning tv         and the gods including jesus are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts  they are either dead sleeping or hiding in heaven with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone  yet life goes on         tales of mystics stories of miracles all in a distant time or a distant place  gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days jehovah too  but now they are silent  all the theologians give are various excuses as to why we dont get to see god anymore         were too lazy were not zealous enough were        sinful its just his plan we put too many of our        own demands on gds appearance if we had the right        faith if we  were willing to meet gd on his terms       yet even the most pious of men have not seen gd  you dear reader have not seen gd  not literally you know that to be true i know thats presumptuous and bold  but searching your heart you know what i mean  all that weve seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing gd  they say our little faith does not merit us to see gd  sometimes they say see the love in these people you worship with see the lives of people change that is seeing gd   thus people get lulled to sleep satisfied with turning gd into the everyday sights   but that is not seeing gd as i am speaking of it is not seeing gd the way people used to see         what we see in the world that is good is the compassion of human hearts the love given and taken by men and women the forgiveness practised by christian  atheist alike beauty created by the mind of man  these are the things that are done these are what we see  but it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith  jesus rides on an ass         shortly after accepting the role of the jewish messiah king jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into jerusalem           mt 215  this took place to fulfil what was spoken        by the prophet saying         tell the daughter of zion behold your king is        coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a        asscolt  of course the passage quoted from zechariah 99 reads a little differently         lo your king comes to you he is triumphant and        victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass        colt he will command peace to the nations  there isnt all that much difference here except that zechariah only involves one animal  an asscolt  while matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently  thus he has jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass  from matthews version we get a comical picture of the divine christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys  this could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma   we find that in the account written earlier by st mark only the colt was called for and brought to jesus  this indeed fits the verses of zechariah properly and shows us that in matthew attempt to use prophetic verses he has bungled  now excluding many respectable christians i have met i have noticed that while christ is thought to have ridden on asses the situation is often reversed nowadays         then entering the jerusalem temple the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling jesus the messiah  but jesus replied as we might expect matthew to have done         mt 2116  havent you read  out of the mouth of        babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise  it is more likely that matthew made this response up since jesus was never one to point out such little prophetic things and since as we might expect the quote is in error which seems to fit matthews track record quite well  we might ask jesus or matthew havent you read for the source reads         psalms 812  o yahweh our lord how majestic is        your name in the whole world   you whose glory is        chanted above the heavens by babes and infants you        have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the        enemy and the avenger  the passages hardly need comment  there is no perfect praise spoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to gd not his messiah king and not jesus  as mentioned it seems to be just one more case of matthews pen making up convenient prophetic scripture  yhvh said to  my lord        jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised jewish messiahking is to be descended  the jews agree it is king david  but then jesus counters by quoting psalms 110         the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until        i put your enemies under your feet  taken at face value jesus is denying the necessity of davidic descent  one assumes he is in opposition to their answer  of course the christian answer is that he agrees but is trying to make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiahking  its tempting to believe this if one is a christian and not interested in matters of investigation  but there are problems        in jesuss time the psalm was thought to be about the messiah  and it is easy to see why david might refer to the messiah as his superior  we need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king bringing the jews to times even better than those under davids rule  of course the jews listening had no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as the christians worship  the problem lies in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several jews of jesuss time had also made  one must remember that there were various factions among the jews often as a result of different expectations of the messiahking  jesus was apparently one of these adventists like his audience who thought the messiahs advent was imminent and who interpreted psalms 110 among others as being messianic what is the problem then  psalm 110 literally reads         yhvhs utterance to my lord 9sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your        footstool         yhvh sends forth your mighty scepter from zion  rule        in the midst of your foes  your people will offer        themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the        holy mountains           you are a priest of the order of melchizedek        forever  the word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord  but in the hebrew the word is adoni and no capitalisation exists  adoni simply means lord a generic term as we would use it  it is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to gd  it is merely an address of respect         there is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiahking  that this is supposed to be written by david is not certain  the title of the psalm translates to either a psalm of david or a psalm about david  it seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet about davids covenant and endorsement from gd  if the psalm had been written by david it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah  the idea of a perfect king descended from david was not present in davids age  we have extensive tales of davids doings and sayings none of which include any praises of a messiah      many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after david was dead in times of the exile when gd had put his show of favour for davids kingdom on hold        the description in the psalm fit david very well  david was promised by gd a rise to power victory over his enemies successful judgement among the nations he conquered  he achieved the priesthood common to melchizedek in being a righteous king enabled to bless the people   it all fits       we do not have to blame this problem on matthew alone though  here there is not artificial prophecy alluded to though his use of the scripture is rather questionable  still this event is common to the other gospels too  so we let matthew off a little more easily this time  it is interesting to note though how matthew dresses up the event  the earlier gospel of mark tells the tale with jesus simply speaking to a crowd  matthew has the pharisees who became the religious competition of an infant christianity be the target of jesuss question  as we might expect matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the pharisees  such power is the pen  moses  jesus had it together all along         we leave the gospel story of matthew momentarily to see a pseudoprophecy in johns gospel  the gospel story of john deserves special treatment because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of jesuss career as told by even matthew  but for the moment we will just look at one verse  the early church leaders founded a religion on the jewish hopes of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by gd  when constructing the history of abraham moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the jewish people  while this was accomplished eventually under the rule of king david the christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise  but to do so they expanded on the promise preaching about a heavenly kingdom         john 856 jc speaking your father abraham        rejoiced to see my day  he say it and was glad  it would be nice to tie in approval for jesus from abraham but abraham knew nothing of jesus or a messiah or anything christian  i have tried and failed to find any event in the old testament which corresponds to johns little prophecy  it is par for the course to see st john making up old testament backings just like his forerunner matthew  many christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud and it is surprising they still cling to it  the potters field        we are told that jesus was betrayed while in jerusalem by one of his followers judas iscariot   matthew writes         mt 27510  and throwing down the pieces of silver        in the temple judas departed but the chief        priests taking the silver said it isnt lawful for        us to put it in the treasury since it is blood        money  so they bought a potters field with it to        bury strangers in then was fulfilled what was        spoken by the prophet jeremiah         and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price        of him on whom a price had been set by some of the        sons of israel and they gave them for the potters        field as the lord directed me  this prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of old testament scripture  first matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet  it is zechariah who utters the verses which matthew makes use of         zech 111213  and they weighed out my wages        thirty shekels of silver  then yhvh said to me cast        them to the treasury the lordly price at which i        was paid off by them  so i took the thirty shekels of        silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of        yhvh  first of all the verses of zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of gd  the deal with a shepherd most likely a priest chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before gd would send judah and israel into conflict with one another  the word treasury had been replaced by the king james scholars with to the potter precisely because this made matthews quote fit better  but this is a blatant error  the correct translation of the hebrew is indeed treasury which also makes perfect sense in zechariahs context whereas potters field is totally unrelated  whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation  however given matthews track record one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty       of course matthew would have ample reason for altering the text  the thirty pieces of silver match judass situation and if as most christians seem to be the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity matthew might have another prophecy to toss around  however the correct translation of zechariah directly contradicts the situation with judas and the high priests  the high priests would not put the money in the treasury  the worthless shepherd of zechariah does exactly the opposite  of course to the average thursdaynight bible student the prophecy as presented by matthew would be taken at new testament face value  to those matthews work is convincing enough  wine vinegar  casting lots        then jesus is led away to be crucified         mt 273435  they gave him vinegar to drink        mingled with gall but when he tasted it he would not        drink it  and when they had crucified him they        divided his garments among them by casting lots that        it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet         they parted my garments among them and upon my        vesture did they cast lots  first of all the vinegar offered to jesus is actually common sour wine of the type that roman soldiers drank regularly  we find that right before jesus dies the soldiers themselves give him some to drink not polluted with gall         jn 192830  jesus said i thirst  a bowl of        vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the        vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth  when he        had received the vinegar he said it is finished  but matthew seems to be drawing on not a passage from the prophets but one from the psalms         ps 692028  i looked for pity but there was none        and for comforters but i found none  they gave me        poison for food lit they put gall in my meat and        for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink  add        to them punishment upon punishment may they have no        acquittal from thee  let them be blotted out of the        book of the living  of course the sour wine offered to jesus is done at his request of drink  this does indeed seem to be a show of pity  the psalm quoted is about david and his political and military enemies  it is not about the messiah or jesus  it is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the jesus in the psalm asks gd for the damnation of the crucifiers whereas the jesus of the gospels says         lk 2334  jesus said father forgive them the        dont know what they do  further matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall a bitter substance put into jesuss drink not his meat as the psalm stipulates         with the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask what of the casting of lots  this brings up the 22nd psalm which deserves discussion all by itself  suffice it now to say that the fact that jesuss clothes were divided as told is no great thing  it turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days  as we will soon see it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to jesus  it does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of jesuss clothes  for a man so removed from worldly possessions his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions  the 22nd psalm        this psalm is attributed to david as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies  it becomes a song of praise to yhvh and of hope  taken out of context parts of it seem to fit the plight of jesus at the crucifixion quite well  we will examine the primary passages         verse 12  my god my god why have you forsaken me         why are you so far from helping me far from the words        of my groaning  oh my god i cry by day but you        dont answer and by night but find no rest  jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross  this suggests that the whole psalm is really about jesus rather than king david  of course the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to jesus or his execution  jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the lamb led mute before its shearers  indeed jesus doesnt do much groaning even when on the cross  he certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross         68  but i am a worm and no man scorned by men         all who see me mock at me  they make faces and wag        their heads  he committed his cause to yhvh  so let        him deliver him for he delights in him  this seems to fit jesuss execution pretty well with the exception of the holy messiah being called a worm         1213  many bulls encompass me they open their        mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion         1618  yea dogs are round about me a company of        evildoers encircle me they have pierced my hands and        feet  i can see all my bones they divide my        garments among them and cast lost for my raiment         1921  but you yhvh be not far away  deliver my        soul from the sword my life from the power of the        dog  save me from the mouth of the lion and my        afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull  it would seem quite convincing and im sure the early christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too  unfortunately this prophecy has a fatal flaw  the words have pierced really do not exist in the psalm  the correct hebrew translation is         16  yea dogs are round about me a company of        evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my        hands and feet  in hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character  the word in the hebrew text is literally like the lion kaari which makes sense in the context and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer  it is convenience that would urge a christian to change the word to kaaru   but to add the needed yet artificial weight to the prophecy this is just what the christian translators have chosen to do  while the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to jesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators         apart from the erroneous verse 16 the psalm does not lend itself to jesus so easily  verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross  this naturally fits the psalms true subject king david  as a side note we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but rather the forearms  this doesnt say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms  but then facts arent bound by our religious beliefs        matthew escapes culpability this time as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord jesus  but the psalm like many others was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of jesuss life and death  how much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for christian theology  it is easy to see for those who are not faithful fundamentalists how some of the events in the new testament might have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager matthew  but it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims  so far this has not said good things for st matthew  the reference to the piercing looks a lot like jesuss crucifixion  johns gospel recount written about 70 years after the fact tells us at jesuss execution         jn 193437  but one of the soldiers pierced his        side with a spear and out came blood and water        these things took place that scripture be fulfilled        the will look on him whom theyve pierced  of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context   prophet zechariah tells us how much of the nation of israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with them         zc 12710  and yhvh will give victory to judah        and on that day i will seek to destroy the nations        that come against jerusalem in judah  and i will        pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on        jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have        pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him        like you weep over a firstborn child  johns attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that matthews attempts  matthew at least usually excontexts more than just one passage  johns errors are grossly obvious and blatant here  it does not speak well for any of the gospel writers as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded   reckoned with transgressors         after his arrest jesus is quickly executed for claiming the jewish kingship messiahship   according to one version of the gospel tale jesus gets executed along with two thieves         mk 1527  and with him they crucified two robbers        one on his right one on his left  and so the        scripture was fulfilled which says         he was reckoned with the transgressors  here mark is trying to link jesus to a passage in isaiah 53 about the servant nation of israel  the passage is not about the messiah for if one reads the whole chapter of isaiah 53 and its surrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a nation  the verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past not a prediction of what is to come in any event  the servant is thought of as a criminal  this also happens to fit the description of jesus  had the passage really been about the messiah it still is not at all clear why executing jesus between two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in isaiah  jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry  he was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career   locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons         mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with jesus also reviled him 1532  this is to be expected from a couple of robbers  of course in his later recount st luke decides to change some things  luke tells us         lk 233943  and one of the criminals who was hanged        with him railed arent you the messiah save        yourself and us  this certainly fits with marks recount which tells how the people who crucified jesus said save yourself and that the robbers did the same  but then luke goes on         but the other criminal rebuked the first saying        dont you fear gd since you are under the same        sentence of condemnation  and we indeed justly so        for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds         but this man has done nothing wrong and he said        jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom         and jesus answered verily i say to you today you        will be with me in paradise  now this little dialogue seems highly contrived  it stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech  we have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering   such a man apparently noble and of principle doesnt seem likely to have been a robber  we wonder at the amount of theatrics created by luke  of course lukes recount also disagrees with marks   luke has only one criminal revile jesus not both  it is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of gd do not have this avenue open  this is yet another example of a writer trying to take an old testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology  in this case the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we have seen  the end of the world        mt 24         now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the new testament  it is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of christianity  jesus mentions the destruction of the jewish temples and buildings and his disciples ask him about this and about the end of the world which he has been warning about         the disciples tell us when will this the temples        destruction be and what will be the sign of your        coming and of the close of the age         jesus take care that no one leads you astray for        many will come in my name saying i am the christ          you will hear of wars and rumours of wars for        this must take place but the end is not yet   for        nation will rise against nation all this is but the        beginning of the birthpangs              they will deliver you up put you to death        and false prophets will arise and lead many astray        but he who endures to the end will be saved  this        gospel will be preached throughout the whole world a        testimony to the nations and then the end will come              so when you see the desolation spoken of by the        prophet daniel let those who are in judea flee to        the mountains               immediately after the tribulation of those days        the sun will be darkened the stars will fall from        heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man        in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn        and see the son of man coming and he will send out        his angels and gather his elect              learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its        branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves you know        that summer is near  so also when you see all these        things you will know that he is near at the very        gate  truly i say to you this generation will not        pass away until all these things take place              but of the day and hour no one knows not the        angels not the son but only the father therefore        you also must be ready for the son of man is coming        at an hour you do not expect  from this it is clear that jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples  he tells them that although he doesnt know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready  theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this holy error  but unfortunately jesus made himself to explicit  he told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the end and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be swept away       there have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the bible and said that the phrase this generation shall not pass away really means this race of people will not pass away  of course the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciples  it is an interesting notion that when god decided to learn greek he didnt learn it well enough to make himself clear  but it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples at least some of them are supposed to live to the end of the world  the charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the apostles responses  it becomes abundantly clear from rev 227 1 peter 47 1 john 218 and rev 2220 that jesus meant exactly what he said  the end was very near         for 2000 years christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of matthew or ignored its meaning altogether  for 2000 years they have waited for their executed leader to come back hearing of wars and rumours of wars sure that he is coming soon  surely he must be  all we must do is wait  can you imagine how tired he must be sitting around up there being holy waiting for just the right moment to spring          so shortly after his crucifixion jesus of nazareth joshuabenjoseph died   it is said that after three days or three days and three nights or three periods of time or three eternal seconds or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble he was seen again resurrected glowing with divine radiance  then the saviour decided it wasnt in the best interests of his new religion to stick around and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven  so the story goes anyway  as has been seen there were many things attributed to jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down  to them jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture  we have seen though that this matter is quite shaky  but throughout church history christians have held fast to faith in simple belief  what doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away from question  to question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters  thus for 2000 years the prophecies cited in the new testament have gone on largely accepted  things may well continue that way for some time  pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of christianity have been accepted and used properly or improperly to support wars and persecution i suppose there is one prophecy of which christianity can securely keep hold         mt 1034  jesus dont think that i have come to        bring peace on earth  i havent come to bring peace        but rather a sword    ,0

1444,1444,from joslinpogoisppittedu david joslin subject re food for thought on tyre organization intelligent systems program lines 113  kingctroncom john e king writes not exactly  the prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the area but by the same token it would never be rebuilt  obviously  if people are still there they would live in houses correct  their nets implies a fishing village  this is exactly what it has become  a far cry from its original position of stature   looking at 1 we find that during roman times tyre vied with sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period that tyre was the seat of a christian bishop eventually with 14 dioceses under it that the most magnificent church of its kind in all phoenecia was the basilica built in tyre ca 314 that tyre was well known for its exports of glassware wine white marble and dyed cloth that tyre along with other seaports provided outlets for south arabian indian and even chinese trade that tyre had to accomodate its growing population by following a perpendicular rather than horizontal line of growth because it was running out of land to build on that tyre established colonies of its own  none of this sounds like a small fishing village by any stretch of the imagination  centuries later under the abbasids tyre had opulent and flourishing bazaars and buildings of 56 stories  during this period tyre was noted for its export of sugar beads and as of old glassware during the crusades tyre was the secondmost flourishing city held by franks  there is a lot more but i got tired of writing  in 2 we read the following description of modern lebanon other major cities in lebanon include tripoli sidon tyre baalbek and zahlah  my emphasis  this source also discusses the impact of the lebanese civil war and the israeli military actions 1978 1982 on the trading ports of tyre and sidon  it notes that after israels withdrawel in 1984 tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy  if tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present why is it always called a city or above a major city  why does it show up on all the maps   when population figures for cities in lebanon are given why is tyre always one of the cities on the list even if the list is only a dozen cities long  1 philip k hitti lebanon in history from the earliest times to the present ny st martins 1967    2 federal research division library of congress lebanon a country study edited by thomas collelo 1989  in the early 1980s tyre had over 22000 people  so far ive seen stated figurers ranging from 15000 to 22000 lets assume the latter one is correct  by modern standards we are talking about a onehorse town  a onehorse town  sounds like a lot of work for one horse anyway tyre is connected by roads to the mainland  they may even use cars these days    the 1991 encyclopedia britannica says pop 1982 est 23000   most other references give figures in the 1417 thousand range one atlas gives the population of tyre as 60000 the same source give comparatively high figures for sidon and beirut also so i doubt that it is a typo  perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas  i dont doubt that the population of tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades  in particular the 1982 israeli military action hurt tyre quite a bit      after alex the g it fell once more in the 1200s i believe  what other times did it fall that you were thinking of   to egypt 250 bce to the seleucids 198 bce rome 63 bce after rome it fell to various arab contingents until 1124 ce when it was captured in the crusades  it was then recaptured again by the muslims in 1291 ce and subsequently pillaged then the french turks british and today lebanon  i thought you were talking about times that tyre was destroyed dont most if not all of these apply not just to tyre but to  the other cities in the area  sidon for example  can you make a case for tyre having been singled out  well it recovered enough to have a thriving commerce in the dye tyrian purple in roman times   this is correct but they were under roman domination and the  majority of the created wealth was siphoned off  the prophesy hold true  they had a good deal of autonomy under the seleucids from 2 tyre received the rights of autonomy from antiochus ephiphanes and from 125 bc onward enjoyed complete autonomy she started a large series of coins occasionally in gold   the descriptions of tyre under the romans dont seem to fit your characterization either  and under the

      mcdonnell douglas  huntington beach                               april 31993       most of you as am i are children of the 1960s  we grew up in an age of miracles  intercontinental ballistic missiles nuclear energy computers flights to the moon  but these were miracles of our parents doing  for a decade and more the pundits have told us  youve lost it  the me generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past       you and i have even begun to believe the pessimists  we listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs  living history they are  we are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it  a few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as general bernie schriever told of his teams work  and yes struggle  to build this nations intercontinental ballistic missile       what stories can we tell  blurryeyed telescopes  thousand dollar toilet seats  even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time  they are and seem destined to remain gen schrievers icbms  i find it hard to swell with pride that the best new spacelifter idea is to refurbish old minuteman and poseidon ballistic missiles       well  the pessimists are wrong  the legacy is continuing  this event is proof  to our technological parents weve listened to your stories  weve caught your enthusiasm and cando spirit  and weve learned from your achievements  and your mistakes  let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history  max hunter  you are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration  your insight and discipline built the thor icbm  later incorporated into todays most successful launch vehicle  the delta       you told us in the 60s that a new form of launch vehicle  a single stage reusable rocket  can and should be built  you advocated this idea tirelessly  it was elegantly simple as are all great breakthroughs  you showed us how to build it  you convinced us it could be done  you are working by our side to weld its components into place  most important  you reminded us of a prime engineering principle  undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you  the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920s and 30s  build a little and test a little and max you passed all of this on  to people like pat ladner who started this program for the sdi       douglas aircraft didnt start with a dc10  they didnt even start with a dc3  our grandfathers built a little tested a little  even sold a little and made a little money  before they moved on to the next step  they didnt take a decade or more before putting the first rubber on the road  max hunter  you didnt take ten years to build thor and by god were not going to take ten years to show that low cost single stage reusable aerospace transportation is real       we ended the cold war in a few short years  it took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the strategic defense initiative that the cold war must end  we  you and us  launched a series of satellites  the delta experiments  in about a year apiece  this more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the soviet union  those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship       but it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation  we will make space access routine and affordable       we built this magnificent flying machine in two years  this summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time  then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable suborbital rocket  it will allow us to use space rapidly affordably and efficiently as no other nation can  and yes  well make a little money off it too       then  and only then  well spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system  the dc3 of space will be a reality  we may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries  what a wonderful irony if this sdi product and russian efforts to counter sdi merge to power mankinds next step to the stars       to be sure we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer  robert goddards first rockets werent saturn vs  if we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system  we will fail  max hunter and his colleagues showed the way  three years and a cloud of dust  in our case rocket exhausts  there is no shortcut  if we expect to reshape the world again  we must do it one brick at a time  minds on tasks at hand       this project is real  the torch of american technological greatness is being passed  we are americans  this machine is american  lets go fly it ,2

liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes  much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself this is probably the wrong group for it  the only relevance here is that you dont seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment actually is and when it is murder  that is when you tell us murder is wrong you are using a term you have not yet defined  well ive said that when an innocent person has been executed this is objectively a murder  however who is at blame is another question it seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risksis to blame  there is a probability of  killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air and  there is a probability of killing an innocent person when the state administers a system of capital punishment  so when you do either you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or  later result in the killing of an innocent person  yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity  presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this  and driving will kill people as will airlines but people continue to do both driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling prisoners by courts  they are risks that we take upon ourselves willingly  and i argue that our law system is a similar risk  perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this  in fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents  if our own driving kills someone else then sure there is a moral issue  i know at least one person who was involved in a fatal accident and they felt vey guilty afterwards  but such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals on the road  again the blame is on society  no im not  this is what you said  you were saying that if there were such a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed  it would still be the fault of the state since it did the actual killing no i just commented that the state does the killing  it does not depend on there being false witnesses  how could it  the state does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes  yes but the state is not at fault in such a case  the state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses  it is possible  so what are you trying to say that capital punishment is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating the system im saying capital punishment is murder period  not because of this that and the other but because it involves taking human life thats my definition of murder  i make no appeals to dictionaries or to objective morals  okay so this is what you call murder  but the question is whether or not all such murders are wrong  are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the circumstances  if we as a society decide to murder someone then we should say that and lists our reasons for doing so and live with the moral consequences  we should not play word games and pretend that murder isnt murder  and thats my opinion about how society ought to be run  but this is basically how it works  society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution  and every member of society shares this blame  and most peoples definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it  but we were trying to discuss an objective moral system or at least its possibilty  what ramifications does your personal system have on an objective one no we were not discussing an objective moral system  i was showing you that you didnt have one because for one thing you were incapable of defining the terms in it for example murder  murder violates the golden rule  executions do not because by allowing it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is  were not talking about reading minds we are just talking about knowing the truth  yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court systems work on a principle of knowing the truth beyond a reasonable doubt   sorry but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately  here is what you said 9and since we are looking totally objectively at this case 9then we know what people are thinking when they are voting to 9execute the person or not  if the intent is malicious and  9unfair then the execution would be murder what you are doing now is to slide into another claim which is quite different  the jury being persuaded beyond a serious doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond a serious doubt  reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not  but in an objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth  that is twelve members must be convinced of a truth  moreover a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence that you and i would laugh at  but then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the conviction was unfair  but would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds  if we assume that it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute truth its not a question of fairness  your claim which i have quoted above is a claim about whether we can know it was fair so as to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder  yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we cant always determine the difference in our flawed system  i think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isnt objectively perfect  you see it doesnt matter if we know it is fair or not  objectively it is either fair or it is not  now theres a huge difference  if we can read minds we can know and if we cannot read minds we can know nothing  the difference is not in degree of fairness but in what we can know  but what we know has no effect on an objective system  i think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system if we are clear on which goals it is supposed to promote im not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that i am pretty sure does not exist  why are you so sure  i simply want people to confront reality  my reality remember  why is your reality important  in this case the reality is that ideal theories apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice system  for every innocent person released from death row there may have been a dozen innocent people executed or a hundred or none at all  we simply dont know  but we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system  now what are we going to do  on the one hand we can pretend that we have an ideal theory and that we can know things we can never know and the justie system is fair and that we can wave a  magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder and go  on our way  well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal we can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible  on the other hand we can recognize that all justice has a small  we hope  probability of punishing the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequences of the systems we set up and then say well here we go murdering again  maybe some of us will even say gee i wonder if all this is strictly necessary  yes we all bear the responsibility  most people seem willing to do this  i think that the second is preferable in that if requires people to face the moral consequences of what we do as a society instead of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word  games  we must realize the consequences of all our actions  why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack  and lest i forget i also dont think we have an objective moral system and i believe i only have to take that idea seriously when someone presents evidence of it  i dont think our country has an objective system but i think such an objective system can exist in theory  without omniscience an objective system is not possible in practice  keith ,0

    what is the purpose of this newsgroup    hitler was an atheist    the bible proves it    pascals wager    what is occams razor    why its good to believe in jesus    why i know that god exists

christian nation    subject what is the purpose of this newsgroup  typical posting  why have a newsgroup about atheism  why do atheists organize in groups   what is there to discuss  response  many things are discussed here including   whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting ones   family  prayer in schools  discrimination against atheists  sunday trading laws  the satanic child abuse myth  whether one should be an overt atheist or stay in the closet  how religious societies prey sic on new college students  how to get rid of unwanted proselytizers  whether religion is a danger to society andor the individual  why people become atheists  of course inevitably altatheism tends to attract evangelical christians looking for someone to convert  most readers of the newsgroup dont  want to be preached to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly illconsidered or uninformed postings    subject hitler was an atheist  typical posting  hitler was an atheist and look at what he did  response  adolf hitler was emphatically not an atheist  as he said himself     the folkishminded man in particular has the sacred duty each in    his own denomination of making peoplestopjusttalking    superficiallyofgodswillandactuallyfulfillgodswilland    notletgodswordbedesecratedorig ital     for gods will gave men their form their essence and their    abilities  anyone who destroys his work is declaring war on the    lords creation the divine will  therefore let every man be    active each in his own denomination if you please and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other          hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will    of the almighty creator bydefendingmyselfagainstthejewiam    fightingfortheworkofthelordorig ital             adolf hitler from mein kampf trans ralph mannheim  of course someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong  its also entirely possible that hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in god  we certainly cant conclude that hes an atheist  though    subject the bible proves it  typical posting  in the bible it says that  response  most of the readers of altatheism feel that the bible is of questionable accuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before  thus any claimed truth in it is of questionable legitimacy  this isnt to say that the bible has no truth in it simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted  many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation any claim that a passage means one thing and one thing only is not legitimate  note that this feeling tends to extend to other books  it is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion    subject pascals wager  typical posting  if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing  but if you dont believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell therefore it is foolish to be an atheist  response  this argument is known as pascals wager  it has several flaws  firstly it does not indicate which religion to follow  indeed there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there  this is often described as the avoiding the wrong hell problem  if a person is a follower of religion x he may end up in religion ys version of hell  secondly the statement that if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing is not true  suppose youre believing in the wrong god  the true god might punish you for your foolishness consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer  another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely  or at least that they are of  comparable likelihood  if in fact the possibility of there being a god  is close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive  so sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already  also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on  evidence with some amount of intuition  it is not a matter of will or  costbenefit analysis  formally speaking the argument consists of four statements    1 one does not know whether god exists   2 not believing in god is bad for ones eternal soul if god does      exist   3 believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist   4 therefore it is in ones interest to believe in god  there are two approaches to the argument  the first is to view 1 as an assumption and 2 as a consequence of it  one problem with this approach in the abstract is that it creates information from no information  this is considered invalid in information theory  statement 1 indicates one has no information about god  but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about god  this violates information entropy  information has been extracted from no information at no cost  the alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions  the problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the christian position and only a christian will agree with that assumption the argument thus collapses to if you are a christian it is in your interests to believe in god  a rather vacuous tautology and not the way pascal intended the argument to be viewed  the biggest reason why pascals wager is a failure is that if god is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager  he will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him    subject what is occams razor  typical posting  people keep talking about occams razor  what is it  response  william of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occams  razor  in its original form it said do not multiply entities  unnecessarily  that is if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity then do so  nowadays when people refer to occams razor they generally express it  more generally for example as take the simplest solution  the relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us  1 there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which came into being as a result of natural processes  2 there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and  there is also a god who created the universe  clearly this god must be  of nonzero complexity  given that both explanations fit the facts occams razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two  solution number one unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution  3 there isnt an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there   we just imagine that there is  this third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people  find unacceptable     subject why its good to believe in jesus  typical posting  i want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion  response  preaching is not appreciated  feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write postings that are on a conversion theme  such postings do not belong on altatheism and will be rejected from altatheismmoderated try the newsgroup talkreligionmisc  you would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you please do unto others as you would have them do unto you  often theists make their basic claims about god in the form of lengthy analogies or parables  be aware that atheists have heard of god and know the basic claims about him if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that god exists and brings salvation you may as well not post it since it tells us nothing we have not been told before    subject why i know that god exists  typical posting  i know from personal experience and prayer that god exists  response  just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist  that evidence varies from person to person  furthermore without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things  that they have been abducted by ufos visited by the ghost of elvis and so on    subject einstein and god does not play dice  typical posting  albert einstein believed in god  do you think youre cleverer than him  response  einstein did once comment that god does not play dice with the universe  this quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in the christian god  used this way it is out of context it refers to einsteins refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory furthermore einsteins religious background was jewish rather than christian  a better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the following i believe in spinozas god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings  einstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer  he believed that qm was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations  so far no such better theory has been found and much evidence suggests that it never will be  a longer quote from einstein appears in science philosophy and religion a symposium published by the conference on science philosophy and religion in their relation to the democratic way of life inc new york 1941  in it he says    the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature  for him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events  to be sure the doctrine of a    personal god interfering with natural events could never be    refuted italics his in the real sense by science for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot     but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal  for a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm    to human progress  in their struggle for the ethical good teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    god that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests  in their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the good the true and the beautiful in humanity    itself  this is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task  einstein has also said    it was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions    a lie which is being systematically repeated  i do not believe in a    personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly    if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it  the latter quote is from albert einstein the human side edited by helen  dukas and banesh hoffman and published by princeton university press   also from the same book    i do not believe in immortality of the individual and i consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it  of course the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does  not in itself imply that christianity is false    subject everyone worships something  typical posting  everyone worships something whether its money power or god  response  if that is true everyone is a polytheist  theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about  if the atheists reactions to for example their families amount to worship then so do the theists    subject why there must be a causeless cause  typical posting  sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so chains of causes must all have a first element a causeless cause  response  the set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but has no smallest member  further even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion    subject the universe is so complex it must have been designed  typical posting  the presence of design in the universe proves there is a god  surely you dont think all this appeared here just by chance  response  this is known as the argument from design  it is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talkorigins for a while  there is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here however the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of socalled scientific creationism furthermore there is much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth  the origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that surely it cant have come about by chance that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately  but if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely  the approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist position  this leads us to the familiar theme of if a creator created the universe what created the creator but with the addition of spiralling  improbability  the only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just is or was  from here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without introducing a creator  indeed stephen hawking in his book a brief history of time explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent with no beginning or end  the argument from design is often stated by analogy in the socalled  watchmaker argument  one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach  does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that it evolved naturally  of course one assumes a watchmaker  yet like the  watch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the  universe too must have a creator  the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above  those common to all arguments by design  firstly a watchmaker creates  watches from preexisting materials whereas god is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing  these two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weak  secondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in  the world  if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor we wouldnt assume it was created by the watchmaker  the argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a  different part of creation  finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature  yet in the second part of the  argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random but shows elements of order  the watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent    subject independent evidence that the bible is true  typical posting  the events of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence  for example  response  the writings of josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence  early versions of josephuss work are thought not to have mentioned jesus or james the extant version discusses john in a nonchristian context  many scholars believe that the original mentioned jesus and james in passing but that this was expanded by christian copyists  several reconstructions of the original text have been published to this effect  much information appears in the ecclesiastical history of eusebius about 320 ce  it is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily eusebius who is generally acknowledged as the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity it is eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material  aside from the new testament the biographical information about jesus is more welldocumented  for further information please consult the frequently asked questions file for the newsgroup socreligionchristian    subject godels incompleteness theorem  typical posting  godels incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the bible to be both true and complete  response  godels first incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid true or false within that formal system  technically speaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system  essentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a liar  paradox  the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is this  sentence is false  note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable  the logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claims that godels incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god are worthless in isolation  one can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of god simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom  this is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof however  it may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with  it may then be possible to show that godels incompleteness theorem holds for that system  however that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god exists within the system  furthermore it certainly wouldnt tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally  note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of god the formal systems are just abstractions  another frequent claim is that godels incompleteness theorem demonstrates that a religious text the bible the book of mormon or whatever cannot be both consistent and universally applicable religious texts are not formal systems so such claims are nonsense    subject george bush on atheism and patriotism  typical posting  did george bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens  response  the following exchange took place at the chicago airport between robert i sherman of american atheist press and george bush on august 27 1988 sherman is a fully accredited reporter and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps  the republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for illinois  the discussion turned to the presidential primary   rs what will you do to win the votes of americans who are atheists   gb i guess im pretty weak in the atheist community  faith in       god is important to me   rs surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       americans who are atheists   gb no i dont know that atheists should be considered as citizens       nor should they be considered patriots  this is one nation under       god   rs do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church   gb yes i support the separation of church and state  im just not       very high on atheists  upi reported on may 8 1989 that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks  the exchange appeared in the boulder daily camera on monday february 27 1989  it can also be found in free enquiry magazine fall 1988 issue volume 8 number 4 page 16  on october 29 1988 mr sherman had a confrontation with ed murnane cochairman of the bushquayle 88 illinois campaign  this concerned a lawsuit mr sherman had filed to stop the community consolidated school district 21 chicago illinois from forcing his firstgrade atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states as one nation under god bushs phrase  the following conversation took place    rs american atheists filed the pledge of allegiance lawsuit yesterday       does the bush campaign have an official response to this filing    em its bullshit    rs what is bullshit    em everything that american atheists does rob is bullshit    rs thank you for telling me what the official position of the bush       campaign is on this issue   em youre welcome  after bushs election american atheists wrote to bush asking him to retract his statement  on february 21st 1989 c boyden gray counsel to the president replied on white house stationery that bush substantively stood by his original statement and wrote    as you are aware the president is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government  for further information contact american atheist veterans at the american atheist presss cameron road address    subject i know where hell is  typical posting  i know where hell is  hell is in norway

fathers shouldnt the united states be considered a christian nation  response  based upon the writings of several important founding fathers it is clear that they never intended the us to be a christian nation  here are some quotes there are many more    what influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on society    in some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people  rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries a just government instituted to secure and perpetuate it    needs them not

   benjamin franklin from articles of belief and acts of religion         nov 20 1728    subject the usa is not a christian nation  typical posting  is it true that george washington said that the united states is not in any sense founded upon the christian religion  response  no  the quotation often given is in fact from article xi of the 1797 treaty of tripoli 8 stat 154 treaty series 358     article 11     as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense    founded on the christian religion  as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of musselmen  and as    the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any mehomitan nation it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries  the text may be found in the congressional record or in treaty collections such as charles bevans treaties and other international agreements of the united states of america 17761949 vol 11 pp 10701080  the english text of the treaty of tripoli was approved by the us senate on june 7 1797 and ratified by president john adams on june 10 1797  it was recently discovered that the arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation it lacks article xi altogether  the person who translated the arabic to english was joel barlow consul general at algiers a close friend of thomas paine  and an opponent of christianity  it is possible that barlow made up article xi but since there is no arabic version of that article to be found its hard to say  in 1806 a new treaty of tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation   end of faq digest  ÿ ,0

bskendignetcomcom brian kendig writes  and i maintain  some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters because they fear it they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own terms    are you your own master  do you have any habits that you cannot break  if i have a habit that i really want to break and i am willing to make whatever sacrifice i need to make to break it then i do so there have been bad habits of mine that ive decided to put forth the effort to break and ive done so there have been other bad habits that ive decided are not worth the effort to break  its my choice either way  i am my own master  i choose what i want to do  i weigh the benefits of my actions against their consequences and i use my experience to help me deal with the unexpected which in turn make me more experienced  i dont always succeed but i never fail either  i learn  do you have any habits you cant break  why not  for one you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the bible  i have arrived at my own understanding of christianity just as youve probably arrived at your own understanding of islam that is most likely very different from the way a moslem thinks of his religion are you unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the quran  if thats different then how is it different from what you accuse me of  can i accuse you of having no desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism  how about sexual sins  gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of   do you dehumanize women when they walk past you  do you degrade them to a sex object in your head  of course not  thats disgusting  for centuries religions have been discriminating on sex and treating women as secondclass humans thats one of the reasons i renounced my christianity  do you insult people unknowingly then regret it later  yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself  no  i dont insult people  period  its not in my nature and its not something that i want to do either  are you truly the master of yourself  not yet  but my life is the ground i use to practice on  the fun is in the getting there  i have admitted that i am not the master of my thought life at all times that i sometimes say things i do want to say and then repeat my mistake unwantingly  i have admitted to myself that i cannot control every aspect of my being  there are times i know i shouldnt say something but then say it anyway  there are times i simply forget a lesson i in fact am not my own master  we dont start out perfect weve got to strive to be something better  i know my shortcomings and i know my strengths and i live my life according to the decisions i make and i am content to abide with the consequences of my decisions as easily as ill accept the praise for them  there have been times in my life when ive made mistakes yes i try to never make the same mistake twice  i need help  jesus promised me this help  and i took him up on his offer  i have willfully let jesus be my master because jesus knows what is better for me than i myself do  i regard christ as a myth  i feel that there are far too many people offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and did  the only person who can really judge me is me  i choose the roads i travel and i decide whether or not i want to reach the end of any given road or turn back  and as long as i dont always turn back theres no shame in it  when i need help i seek out my friends  do you see my point  i think youre the one under the rock and im getting a great tan out here in the sunlight  my life has improved immesurably since i abandoned theism  come and join me  it will be a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the long hike but its well worth it  then i guess ignorance is bliss for you  because brian you enjoy not having a clue about the bible     and you dont have a clue about what im saying either  open your eyes and see open your ears and listen  im not just spouting off empty words  this is my life this is what gives me meaning  dont you see  im not going to accept anything that i cant witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not something as megapowerful as what youre trying to get me to accept surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good reason to dont you  can you witness motherly love with your senses  how does caring and concern for you register with your senses  if nothing registers to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch then you better become a vulcan and fast  you better get rid of your emotions  huh  youre going way off the track here  i say my mother loves me  how do i know you ask  i can point to definite things shes done for me and i can even just bring her to you so you can ask her facetoface  you say your deity loves you  how do you know i ask  you cant even convince me that it exists  my god says that you will not cease existing  you have life forever  you can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever or can choose to  live it in paradise with god  that is what my god says  and that was the issue  your madeup theism is what it ismade up  its wishful thinking  if any god dangles heaven before me like a carrot promising untold pleasures to me if ill only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once then i would choose hell  i can not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful it is  note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way yahweh allah zeus odin ra  please give me a solid reason to choose one of them over the others   description of kendigism deleted  hee hee   why would you want to live a good life to you you die and thats it  dont contradict yourself  you have no reason to live a good life  it doesnt do you any good in the end  your life doesnt do anybody else any good  either because everyone dies anyway  so you have no reason to lead a good life leading a good life is meaningless   why do you do such a meaningless thing  that paragraph demonstrates that you havent listened to a single word ive said  have you ever gone to an amusement park  why  i mean after a few hours it closes and nothings different except that youre a few dollars lighter  going to the amusement park doesnt do you any good at all  why do you do such a meaningless thing  the answer is that you think its fun  you play the skeeball over and over because youd like to get better at it even though youre not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you blow ten dollars on it  you ride the roller coaster because its an thrilling experience even though because it scares the dickens out of you  in the same way i think life is fun  and i dont intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night  d  im sorry i dont feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god id worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case its not really all that important  has the resurrection sunk in  jesus is alive  jesus is not dead  so you and your holy book say  by the same token therefore santa claus delivers toys every xmas  dont you see  i have no reason to believe that what you say is true  please give me some reason that i cant similarly apply to santa claus  forget the bible for a minute  forget quoting verses forget about who said what about this or that  show me  picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop and convince me that youre right  forget that i am a person  forget that i know how to type  forget that i know how to put a sentence together  forget that i know how to send email   forget my existence  proove to me that i exist    i cant do it because your existence means nothing more to me than just your communications over the net  you have no more bearing on nor importance in my life than that remove it and you will cease to be significant to me  are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a collection of verses in a book and cannot be supported without invoking them  or do you mean that the existence of your deity and in fact any other deity that can be written about is as real as your own existence  why do you believe what you believe      brian kendig                             je ne suis fait comme aucun   bskendignetcomcom                de ceux

newsgroups talkreligionmisc subject re new biblical contradictions fallaciously answered judas date thu apr  1 205211 1993   i can basically restrict this post to showing the type of evidence mr decenso has presented and answering his two questions and a couple of his spurious insults and false claims   my reply ok   db by the way mr decenso you really should have looked in the index of your bauerarndtgingrich greek lexicon  you would have found that the word in acts for lot is kleros not chorion as stated by mr archer and nowhere in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to theological dictionary of the new testament by bromley is the meaning burial plot discussed  it discusses the forms of kleros eg kleros kleroo etc and the various meanings of kleros eg plot of land and inheritance but mentions nothing about chorion or burial plot why does this not surprise me thus it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped archer as a reference   db later corrected himself  from davebpogowvtekcom dave butler newsgroups talkreligionmisc subject re new biblical contradictions fallaciously answered judas date fri apr  2 023211 1993   i owe the group an apology  it is my habit to check my articles before and after their submission for errors  in my last article i stated    by the way mr decenso you really should have looked in the index of your  bauerarndtgingrich greek lexicon  you would have found that the word in  acts for lot is kleros not chorion as stated by mr archer and nowhere  in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to theological dictionary  of the new testament by bromley is the meaning burial plot discussed  it  discusses the forms of kleros eg kleros kleroo etc and the various  meanings of kleros eg plot of land and inheritance but mentions  nothing about chorion or burial plot why does this not surprise me thus  it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped archer as a reference   i was wrong i admit that i do not have a handle on greek grammar and thus confused kleros the second to last word in acts 117 as being the plot of land discussed  in actuality it is chorion which is the last word acts 118  unfortunately my greek dictionary does not discuss chorion so i cannot report as to the nuances of the word   i dont know if someone else would have caught this though i am sure that someone would be able to do so but i have an aversion to disseminating mistakes especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point      my reply vary noble of you dave  i didnt want to have to go to x number of sources to show you wrong  although i am researching chorion a little   db of course the only other reference mr decenso has given is bullinger  and bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when i accused mr decenso of actually believing bullinger he replied that i misquoted him    and you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing  oh dear   my reply  your misquotes of me are astounding dave  read the beginning of this part of  my response to see what i really said in my posting of this article    actually mr decenso you said that there was benefit to our argument in   that it caused to to rediscover bullingers exegisis  i did not realize   that you would find such garbage beneficial unless you were convinced by   it   my reply thank you for correcting your restating of my points   db and mr decenso also replied    dave these are not necessarily my views they are bullingers  we will  discuss the land issue in later posts im sure  im only responding to this one you have directed re bullingers views because its enjoyable   thus i apologize for thinking that even mr decenso could find such drek convincinghe should specify which parts of bullinger he finds convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of this is what bullinger believed not necessarily what i believe so which is it mr decenso do you find the exegisis convincing or not   my reply one of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various bible scholars and students alike  when i present my views i will clearly distinguish them from now on   db of course without archer and bullinger we find that mr decenso has presented no greek exegisis at all and mr decenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual greek  thus we find this demand on his part for quality greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement   my reply good point  but in your declaring that these passages are contradictory you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations nor have you dug deeper  im glad you have begun in this post  i will begin greek studies on these passages in more depth than i thought necessary as well   db it would be appropriate to look at what mr decenso has actually used as evidence  now we know what he claims for a standard as he has stated it often enough    a the text itself  b parallel passages  c other pertinent scriptures  d historical context  e historical content  f other pertinent historical info  g cultural context  h cultural content  i other pertinent cultural info  j grammatical construction  k hebrew and greek word studies  l etc   but are these actual standards he has used or simply empty hyperbole  lets see he has used a and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages we see that he has also used b  on the other hand he has presented no use of   d historical context                or e historical content                or f other pertinent historical info   or g cultural context                  or h cultural content                  or i other pertinent cultural info     or j grammatical construction          or even k hebrew and greek word studies remember archer and bullinger dont count   thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings   my reply question  do you find such criteria important  if so do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability or will you continue to present shallow observations i dont mean this in a bad way at this point in our debates i have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses  i do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re judas in acts and matthew but i will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria since you desire me to  i hope you will also it will greatly enhance our study of these passages   db the only thing he has actually used beyond the passage itself is any other passage  thus mr decenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be    a the text itself  b parallel passages   my reply the reason is simpleyou are mistating the passages  you claim that the passages contradict one another i do not see the passages contradicting one another 1 they may very well be complimentary as many scholarly sources mention 2 matthew may not be presenting judas death as you claim  but well look at your defense of this later   also the reward of iniquity in the acts passage may not be the 30 pieces of silver in matthews passages  although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is   at this beginning stages in our debates we are laying some scriptural groundwork which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis   db of course the only reason i can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with judas death is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct   my reply one of the reasons i have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary  however i see no problem in tony roses explanation of judas death      how would you explain the inaccuracy between judas hanging himself in matthew 275 and falling headlong he burst open    this question of the manner in which judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious irreconcilable error some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts however this is not the case at all matthew relates that judas hanged himself while peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact the two statements are indeed different but do they necessarily contradict each other matthew does not say that judas did not fall neither does peter say that judas did not hang himself this is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white both accounts can be true and supplementary a possible reconstruction would be this judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom after he hung there for some time the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas fell down the ledge mangling his body in the process the fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this explanation this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined  from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down tearing his body open it is important to remember that we are not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall louis gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself this individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head he then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time on the other hand a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building in this case both are true as both are true in the case of matthews and peters accounts of the death of judas it is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event      your only reason for rejecting this is i believe your attempt to discredit inerrancy  you havent related how this is impossible or highly unlikely heres what you said in an earlier post    db quoting tony rose  there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom  therefore it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks  on this way down tearing his body open it is important to remember that we                                             are not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced    was the decomposition of his body before his fall   the added text in this version is so heavy that assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics you should find it not credible  but you seem to find tony roses eisegesis satisfactory while clearly rejecting david joslins      here you discredit tonys explanation based on what you deem too heavy for the passages  but you havent addressed why you feel that way  you can say its a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction but that doesnt tell me it didnt happen nor have you shown why you reject that possibility   questions  is matthew lying or is luke lying  or are they both lying  or are either or both of them misinformed  why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction  i do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect   db at present though mr decenso only asks two questions of me    1 you claim acts and matthew contradict one another in representing judas      death  i ask you again to provide evidence that matthew stated judas      died in the hanging  2 you claim that the 30 pieces of silver in matthew that judas threw down      in the temple and the chief priests used is the reward of iniquity      in acts that pictures judas in some way purchasing a field with      therefore there is a contradiction  prove that the 30 pieces of silver      and the reward of iniquity are one and the same   actually i find question 1 to be a rather stupid request but i will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points  first i would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life  in fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging except in fantasy cowboy movies and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging   my reply i work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect  today i got a call re a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack  he failed in his attempt and is in a childs psych ward at a local hospital  hanging attempts are not always successful   to assume that because most hangings are successful this one was also is begging the question if i may quote you   last night listening to the bible answer man broadcast the christian research institutes show one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use  i am not all that familiar with them  the man on the bam show teaches comparative religion and logic  it was interesting   db this is so prevalent that so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself   my reply qualifiers are important at times as well see in an ot passage ill mention below does hanging always have this outcome  did matthew who is the only source we have re judas hanging himself state that judas died as a result  to say its synonymous means it has the same meaning as  a boy age 14 hung himself  but he lived  this is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover   db now i am not alone in this thought in fact since mr decenso so respects christian scholarly including greek scholars opinion i did some research   my reply thank you dave   db interestingly not one of the christian references i read interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide                 my reply  above mine so its ok to use christian sources to back your points  what about tonys position  do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility   also is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong or lying or deceived in other parts of their books  if so should we do as we have done with archer toss them to the side and not value anything they say including their interpretation of the hanging of judas  i am sure you would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources   you also noted they interpreted the hanging as meaning he died  although that is very possibly true do you find that in the text itself  remember thats the first criteria we must examine   db this included       the biblical knowledge commentary by woodward and zuck   my reply which i own  its a good source of commentary info  but not inerrant   db     the interpreters on volume commentary on the bible by laydon     the one volume bible commentary by j r dunelow     word meanings of the testament ralph earl     the abingdon bible commentary published by abingdon     harpers bible commentary by william neal      actually i could have presented many more as well   my reply i appreciate your doing this research dave  maybe we are getting somewhere in how we both should approach these alleged contradictions  more in depth study   db in each case these references specifically describe that the interpretation of matt 275 as successful suicide and thus i can only conclude that the                                          greek word apagchwie hang oneself is translated as a successful hanging   my reply  above mine no you cant only conclude this although as tony says this was a highly probable outcome  but matthew does not state death as being a result   the greek word is apagcho  matthew 275 is its only occurrence in the new testament   in the septuagint the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesus its only used in 2 samuel 1723  now when ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed he saddled a donkey and arose and went home to his house to his city then he put his household in order and hanged himself and died and he was buried in his fathers tomb                notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel hanged himself gr sept apagcho but it explicitly adds and died  here we have no doubt of the result in matthew we are not explicitly told judas died   also there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure  it simply means hang oneself   db but mr decenso you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                       christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful   my reply above mine reputable  you mean ones that have never erred as far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful that cant be done even by me    as i said in an earlier post    although i still agree with tonys exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding judas death taking into account several criteria ive recently noticed some new things in matthew   mat 2758 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful to put them into the treasury because they are the price of blood and they consulted together and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers in therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day   first of all notice that the text does not say that judas died as a result of hanging all it says is that he went and hanged himself luke however in acts tells us that and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out this is a pretty clear indication along with the other details given in acts  peters speech the need to pick a new apostle etc that at least after judas fall he was dead so the whole concept that                                                      matthew and luke both recount judas death is highly probable but not clear  cut     i also wrote    my reply   here we have a stickler dave that i have to say i just recently noticed lets look at the passage in matthew   mat 274 saying i have sinned by betraying innocent blood and they said what is that to us you see to it   mat 275 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself   mat 276 but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful to put them into the treasury because they are the price of blood   mat 277 and they consulted together and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers in   mat 278 therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day   notice verse 5then hewent and hanged himself matthew does not say judas died does it  should we assume he died as a result of the hanging                       what does acts say act 118 now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out   act 120 for it is written in the book of psalms let his dwelling place be desolate and let no one live in it and let another take his office   here we may have a graphic explanation of judas deathso my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth rethe two accounts of judas death is thismatthew doesnt necessarily explain how judas died he does                  say judas hanged himself but he didnt specifically say judas died in the hanging incident                 however acts seems to show us his graphic demise  therefore there is no contradiction between matthew and acts re judas death      my reply we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably records his death  although its possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks thereby bursting open i can no longer assume that to be the case  therefore no contradiction  matthew did not say judas died as a                                           result of the hanging did he  most scholars believe he probably did but     i quoted all that to show that i highly regard the scholars explanations but in looking at the texts initially we cant assume judas died  it is however highly probable                               db by the way while all agree that judas died from the hanging the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing  one simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to matthews version as the correct version in both matt and acts  the biblical knowledge commentary suggested the hypotheses that judas hung and then when he rotted his belly exploded which doesnt explain his headlong fall or that his branch or rope broke and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out which doesnt explain how a hanging man would fall headlong rather than feet first   my reply the outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factorshow high the person was suspended before the fall any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks etc  in a superficial examination of the acts passage and the matthew passage we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics but tony in the above quoted post gave us some    a possible reconstruction would be this judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom after he hung there for some time the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas fell down the ledge mangling his body in the process the fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this explanation this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined  from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down tearing his body open    db now truthfully i do not see what is comforting about matthew confusing the source of the potters field prophesy but on the other hand the author is correct matthew does make that confusion  of course a biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the bible is guaranteed true by god will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of judas ie where the prophesy of the potters field came from   my reply please when we are done with this study on his death remind me to discuss this with you   db as to your second question mr decenso you ask how we could be sure that the money with which judas purchased the land was indeed for the betrayal rather than some other source  i would point out that in acts where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity acts 118 it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about ie acts 116 concerning judas who was guide to those who arrested jesus  now i would point out that when the bible describes an act of iniquity and then immediately discusses the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed   my reply dave we are getting somewhere arent we   act 115 and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty and said act 116 men and brethren this scripture had to be fulfilled which the holy spirit spoke before by the mouth of david concerning judas who became a guide to those who arrested jesus act 117 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry act 118 now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out act 119 and it became known to all those dwelling in jerusalem so that field is called in their own language akel dama that is field of blood act 120 for it is written in the book of psalms let his dwelling place be desolate and let no one live in it and let another take his office   notice that in verse 16 the word iniquity is not used  rather it states that judas became a guide to those who arrested jesus but the writer did not stop therevs 17 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry  what part did judas play in their ministry           joh 126 this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the money box and he used to take what was put in it joh 1329 for some thought because judas had the money box that jesus had said to him buy those things we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor   so now we know what part judas played  he was a treasurer per se right after peter stated that judas played a part in this ministry treasurer according to john then luke adds the parenthetical explanation of wages of iniquity  money that should have been put into the ministry but was stolen by judas to purchase a field  i believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the wages of iniquity are  what do you think dave   db now since i have given you clear answers and even references perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are instead of asking me what type i think you are as you did to mr joslin   my reply i will gladly admit that i am a complete inerrantist although i do not have that big a problem with the limited inerrancy view  frank   if one wished to contend with him he could not answer him one time out  of a thousand  job 93 ,3

remain flat in 1993 with current data showing only a 2 percent  growth over 1992  as published in us industrial outlook 1993  which was released in january revenues from the 1993 us space  business are currently projected to be about 4890 m     in contrast to previous years when us commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates this years projected results are  driven by the us satellite manufacturing industry where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth 1300 m in 1992 to 7  satellites worth  670 m in 1993  the us industrial outlook also  projects us commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  450 m future sales will be adversely affected by the downward  revision in department of defense launch plans                               offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to 1900 m primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable tv networks  similarly remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to 250 m in 1993 up 15    us commercial

have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business     furthermore sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data expected to be released about mid year  data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales including  such items as gps receivers and portable satellite terminals  appears to be missing from the january data set  doc usually  publishes a listing of  space business indicators in midyear and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then  i expect the revised revenues should easily top 5000 m if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers and the year should show about a 10 overall market growth     looking beyond this years data future markets look quite  promising  the doc projects satellite service revenues could top  3000 m by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 1520  per year  through the mid 1990s  my numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for nearterm market growth but i agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in us commercial space sales over at least the  next 510 years  my pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in leo communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services  i dont believe all of the  current players in the yettobeborn leo communications satellite  market and in the yettobeproven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected     it should also be noted this years doc data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities  the 60 m shown in the janurary data is primarily for  the spacehab module planned for launch in april on the space  shuttle but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module   2 delta wins two key launch contracts    mcdonnell douglas corporation which builds and markets the delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts  motorola  inc announced in mid february that it had selected the delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66satellite iridium leo  communications constellation and in mid april mcdonnell douglas  was awarded the usaf medium launch vehicle iii contract     the launch services contract with motorola for the iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 iridium  satellites  another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by khrunichev enterprise in russian on 3 proton vehicle  launches  these 45 satellites planned for the delta will be  launched 5 at a time  providing for at least 9 launches   additional satellites in the iridium constellation such as a  planned onorbit spares may also be launched on delta  although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation and not yet final     the usaf mlv contract also went to mdc bidding a variant of  their delta ii launcher  this contract is only initially worth 75  million but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002  these  launches will deploy the next generation of the usafs global  positioning system block iir navigation satellites plus other  programs  first option for to meet the usaf launch options is  expected to be exercised this year after which the usaf is expected  to request launches of up to 6 deltas per year for at least 6 years   under this contract the usaf can also request launch on demand  services from mdc for the 19962002 time period with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request      commentary  if these two contracts are fulfilled they should  provide an excellent business base for mdcs delta launch program  through the turn of the century  combined these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches worth about 2200 m to mdc and  sustaining a core business base of 300400 myear  other contracts  for international and commercial payloads as well as for nasa  medium elvclass payloads will add to this business base  keeping  mdc as a viable commerical launch company      however it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts  motorolas iridium leo communications constellation has  not yet received a us federal communications commission license for  operation in the us nor has motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the iridium venture  without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no iridium launches   but hopefully these uncertainties will be settled this year     similarly the usaf mlv iii program has been the target of  several congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the gps block iir satellites and deleted the funding for the mlv iii  program in favor of the usaf nlsspacelifter program  at this  time while it appears the mlv iii contract will be executed future  funding for the mlv iii and other usaf commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews  some opinions expressed from within the administration and  congress propose cancellation of all elv upgrade programs  including the mlv programs in favor of the proposed spacelifter  program  such opinions may have some weight in this years budget  deliberations particularly as dod funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking us defense budget    3 commercial remote sensing venture gets doc goahead    the first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early february by the us department of  commerces office of space commerce  a license was granted to  worldview imaging corporation of oakland california to build and  operate a pair of leo imaging satellites to provide multispectral  images of the earth     commentary  there has been little data released on this venture  by worldview and the doc other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license  this was reported to be at the  request of worldview  most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a star wars spinoff using sditype technology to  provide digital earth sensing data and heavily integrated into  digital gis databases for remote sensinggis users  most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists  agricultural planners and urban planners      it is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 land remote sensing policy act  the act as passed last  november provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices  prior to  this act remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the governmentset landsat data prices     there are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development  i think the large landsat and spot satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so  in contrast to these large  governmentsponsored remote sensing systems smaller market ventures  such as worldview and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology and i believe can find profitability on the  margin  i predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so                    4 investment firm calls gds space biz still a good investment     wall street investment house morgan stanley thinks general  dynamics space systems division could still be a moneymaker  despite having failed in the last 3 atlas launches  in a recent  analysts report morgan stanley said we are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the atlas to its historical  95plus success rate this will become a highly profitable cash generating unit  based upon discussions with gds corporate  management morgan stanley projects that if the atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see 70 m in earnings per year by 1995 and  100 m per year by 2000  this is based upon gds projection of  capturing about 10 atlas launches per year on the world market     commentary  three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt general dynamics space systems division  since gd has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses  many market pundits have been speculating gds space business might  be next to be sold  the morgan stanley report indicates gds space  systems division has some potential as a moneymaker despite current  problems  if they can get their act together  sales are projected  to be about 560 m in 1993 which will probably generate a loss of  about 25 m  if gd can capture their projected share of the space  launch market and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their atlas launchers then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales  but until they demonstrate the atlas centaur  program is back on track this division will continue to show  substantial losses     in response to the selloff rumors in my opinion this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability   to do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm   in gd ssds case to get the division back on track the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the atlas centaur as well as in selling atlas services  this would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent inhouse and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services  optimally the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well  candidates for  this might be trw rockwell lockheed and martin and possibly  mcdonnell douglas and boeing  but most of those firms have cash  flow problems mdc have had a substantial business contraction  boeing and mdc are involved with other launch firms lockheed  or have taken on substantial debt martin  and coming up with the  7001500 m purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company    5  ariane predicts dip in launch demand    arianespace the operator of the ariane launch system is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990s  in early  february arianespace released their annual market survey which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade     over short run arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market  of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995 ariane  holds contracts for 31 general dynamics atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts mcdonnell douglas delta holds 7 and great walls long  march vehicle holds 2 launch contracts     threequarters of future launch contracts for which ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25 split between weather earth observation and  scientific satellites  most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the asiapacific region     arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders  arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20  over todays average level to  about 3000 kg in geo     demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years but in the second half of the  decade arianespace predicts demand will decrease  arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or nearterm transponders     one of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles including russian  launch systems  but arianespace predicts that in the long term  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price and that russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal     commentary  ariane releases their market surveys annually and  i reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of csnsti   comparing the two surveys there arent outstanding differences in  the numbers   the most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit    i note that in contrast to some predictions demand for space based communications transponders appears to be remain strong while  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established pointtopoint telecommunications markets growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for pointto multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand  fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service but only from established point a to established point b  to establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points and while there are improved network solutions  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars      for broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution  and if new services are required into a new region it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network  this allows rapid growth of new satellite services and  has kept demand high  the replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well since as demand grows between the points serviced  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic     since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly satellite market projections remain rosy  but  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes  current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  onorbit service or more in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generations satellites  this has cut back some of the launch  demand as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals     and as last note arianespace didnt flag it this year but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over supplied by existing launch systems in the near term  the annual  commercial launch demand is for about 1520 medium sized satellites  per year  from the supply side ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year delta is capable of  about 912 per year atlas is capable of 612 long march 48  japans hvehicle 24 russias proton capable of 8 and other  systems such as zenit and soyuz another 1020 medium launches per  year  thats a lot of capability for a small market     we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches  6 ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort     the 9 feb pegasus launch by orbital sciences corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules  a valid abort order from a nasa range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules      in the last few minutes of the pegasus launch countdown one of  two abort command receivers aboard the pegasus failed  such a failure  typically scrubs a launchand a nasa range safety officer at  wallops island va issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled pegasus launch  somehow this command was  overridden by the osc launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels and the pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call     fortunately the pegasus functioned as expected and the abort  command receiver was not needed  but this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreedto  launch constraint rules and was not obeyed     leading the investigation is the national transportation safety  board ntsb with support from nasa osc and the air force  this  investigation marks the first time ntsb has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch  according to the ntsb their  investigation will take about 6 months and is primarily looking at  lines of authority communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch    commentary this is the first time that the ntsb has led an  investigation into a space launch  their leadership was requested  by the department of commerces office of commercial space  transportation who had licensed the commercial launch      at the time of writing this column some of the initial  investigations have been concluded and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press  apparently 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test after  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding the nasa test  director and range controller in the mission control room at wallops  island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch   according to the mission rules this should have stopped the launch  somehow the osc test conductor ordered the abort reversed and the  nasa communicator on the net relayed that order to the b52 carrying  the pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch  differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed  with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch      as we see more and more commercial launches more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved    this case is interesting because it is the first time the ntsb has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem as they  do with commercial aircraft problems      i think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated   7 another pegasus competitor is announced    tsniimach enterprise in russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system based upon converted icbm components   two versions of the launcher are being marketed the aerokosmos  winged vehicle launched like the osc pegasus and the severkosmos  launched from a mobile ground transporter  the aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit and the severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km  also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a leo data relay system called  sineva  tsniimach enterprise is described as a exmilitary  establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  buran shuttle system  they are located near the npo energia  facility in kaliningrad outside of moscow     commentary theres very little released information on this new  venture  my suspicion is it is another russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their inhouse  knowledge of exsoviet launch systems  it adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the exsoviet union     this ones a little different in that they are offering variants  of exsoviet icbms but i cant identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing  8 georgia launch site dropped from planning    in late january georgia tech research institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in camden county georgia at the old kingsland  missile test launching site on the atlantic coast  the preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns plus environmental and other geographic  considerations  however the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses and recommended other potential uses     commentary  this should put the nails in the coffin of the  kingsland commercial launch site  while other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development      this might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site  these include    is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs    is there a market advantage of using the site    can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site    can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment      other commercial launch site ventures  including those at  woomera poker flat cape york white sands alabama offshore  platform hawaii and vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria  in my opinion some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grounds  9 spains capricornia launcher still proceeding    in one of his last official acts former president bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between us and other firms  one of these was a proposed  use of us technology by spain to build a small booster  with that  regulatory impediment removed the 3stage capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year planning for a first  launch in the 199596 time period  the capricornia is described as  a small 3stage all solid booster designed to put 250500 kg into  leo  several launch sites are being examined for the system  including 2 on the iberian peninsula and 1 on the canary islands   originated by inta in spain the project reports it has  30 m in  development funding and will use technology from argentinas condor  launch vehicle as well as from the us     commentary  several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the european market  small  payloads from european firms or organizations currently use either  ariane piggyback launches or the usitalian scout launcher   however ariane piggyback opportunities are limited and the scout  program is being phased out accompanied by some disarray in the  italian government and space industry regarding any followon  system      this has left an apparent niche for a new european small launch  system  surprisingly enough esa has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure  studies  have been performed by british aerospace aerospatiale deutsche  aerospace and italian organizations but with the exception of the  swedishpacastro system reported below i have not been able to  find any other european development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware     also of interest is the linking of the capricornia to the  argentinian condor launcher  there have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of argentina over the past year about a space  launcherirbm program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970s and early 1980s     what is known is in feb 1992 the argentinian air force formally  transferred control of the condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian argentinian national space agency comison nacional de  atividades espaciales  cnae  the condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983 expanding upon the smaller condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with egypt and with support of german  firms  the condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by iraq  in the mid1980s  fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested but argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system     it should be noted cnae is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994  the us 9 m 181 kg sacb  satellite will study the earths upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from italy and the us no launch vehicle has  yet been selected but oscs pegasus and the russian burlak air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract   10 pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp    pacastro a small launch firm in herndon virginia announced in  late february it had received a 6 m launch reservation contract  from the swedish space corp to launch a satellite on pacastros pa2  launch vehicle   this will be performed as part of the polar  satellite service pss a joint norwegian space center swedish  space corp program to upgrade the andoya rocket range in norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions  according  to pacastro pss is also performing an 8 m upgrade of the andoya  launch facilities including a new integration facility and a fully enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the pacastro pa2  pacastro has been chosen as the main  alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by pss from andoya  the date of the launch of the  swedish satellite was not specified     commentary  pacastro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now  the pa2 is a  small two stage rocket fueled by rp1 and liquid oxygen  from  pacastros literature the engines designed for the paseries  rockets are built of off the shelf components based upon the lunar  module descent engines built by trw and are capable of putting a  225 kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit      pacastro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three pa2 vehicles with a first launch planned for 1995 and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996  my records show pacastro hired  trw to provide marketing support and systems design  with primary  engineering to be done by aeroastro a small satellite builder  closely associated with pacastro headquartered in the same  building  the swedish space corporation would supply engineering  launch operations vehicle subsystems and marketing support  sumitomo corp of tokyo is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors      pacastro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  550 k  some sources place this of high as 1 m but has been  searching for about a year for the additional 2030 m needed to  design build and launch their first set of vehicles     the launch reservation from ssc can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board but by my estimate they will need  much more than the single 6 m sale to put their venture into real  hardware   11 china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported     in early march it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a taiwanese and mainland chinese was in the works   as reported in the taipei press china development corp cdc  headquartered in taiwam and with links to the ruling nationalist  party is planning to set up a joint venture in hong kong with china  great wall industry corp with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite cdc would cover about 10 of the satellite  system cost us 10 m in exchange for rights to 10 of the  satellites communications channels      commentary  this announcement came close on the heels of the  release of taiwanese plans for space development released in mid  january   in those plans the national space program office of  taiwan will launch 3 satellites starting with rocsat1 a 400 kg  scientific spacecraft planned for launch in 1997  two additional  satellites are planned both communications satellites   trw has  been helping taiwan plan this program budgeted at t136 b us 530  m through 2006      i havent been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the nspot but there might be a connection   while taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures the  current taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures     the reported name for the tiawanesechinese system is asiasat 2 but i dont thinks this has any relationship with the existing  hong kongbased asiasat program involving chinese hong kong and  other asian investors other than using it as an organizational  model  there are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture  it could provide excellent firsthand experience to  taiwan for a very low cost which then can be used in later  satellite ventures  but there are internal political issues between  taiwanese and chinese ventures but putting any joint venture  through a  hong kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed     in any case the east asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues  this  is just another indicator to add to the list   12 south korea announces national move into space technologies    south koreas trade industry and resources ministry recently  announced plans to invest us22 b in research and development and  another us17 b into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies  space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multipurpose satellite by  1997  the objective of this investment is to raise south koreas  aerospace technology to the level of the worlds top 10 countries by  2000                                     commentary south korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry specifically including space  activities im noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market     as part of their national effort 2 national telecommunications  satellites for korea telecom will be launched in april and oct 1995  on delta designated koreasat 1 and 2 the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the korean peninsula  southwestern japan and portions of china bordering north korea     south korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  ariane in aug 1992 called uribyol1 our star and costing about us  88 m  uribyol2 is planned for piggyback launch in october of  this year again on ariane and will be entirely made in korea   uribyol3 projected for a 1995 launch will be an environment monitoring microsatellite     this satellite may be the precursor to a series of small earth  observation satellites  the keos korean earth observation system  project which has been submitted for approval to the south korean  government would use two or three 300kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors    south korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001  supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort  funded at us  500 m between 1993 and 2001 in anticipation of an   expected pullout of us intelligencegathering systems from the  korean peninsula           in conjunction with all of these reported efforts south korean  is also pursuing production work either as offsets to existing  aerospace technology contracts for example mcdonnell douglas is  offsetting production of some delta parts to south korean firms as  part of the koreasat launch contracts or for production of  consumer space items among other products south korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to japan and samsung has  announced teaming for production of oscs orbcomm user terminals      this looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies   considering that east asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services primarily for telecommunications a  south korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade   13 space technology indexes through march    as announced in the last csnsti each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments  the table below summarizes results to the end of  march  the space technology index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole as represented by the sp 500 index  since 90  of the values included in the index are us firms this represents a  general increase in the market value of spacerelated firms  the  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992  which  is a very promising sign although future months may reverse this  trend the commercial space technology index has also done quite  well but the pure play portfolio  consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies  has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993  well keep an eye on these      index results through march                            beginning  beginning      1 jan 93 to

1697,1697,from richbellaceraamailamdahlcom subject exgay was homosexuality fact  fiction lines 152 returnpath amailamdahlcomrichbellacerajutscccamdahlcom  tony  while i honestly believe you believe you are doing a good thing by posting that piece of propaganda i believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people  i have seen the film called the gay agenda and along with my church we found it to be horrifying  not because of what was actually shown cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it  the truth is that neither you nor i can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay but knowing as many as i do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life i have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report something obviously claimed against gays as well  the truth is that unless you are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing  i speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society  i do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by christian fundamentalist extremists but i know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be  it is no mistake that the apa removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses it is also no mistake that there are many christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list i do not feel threatened by gays i dont understand why others are  the following is an article concerning two of the more popular exgay min istries  exodus international  homosexuals anonymous  the founder of an exgay support group chooses homo over hetero  by robert pela from gay oriented magazine advocate  in december 1985 david caligiuri received one of the advocates homophobia rewaa awards the a prayer a day keeps the lust away citation  as director of free indeed a national exgay ministry caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians a way out of the homosexual deathstyle through prayer  id like to give the award back caligiuri now laughs im no longer deserve it   caligiuris eight year involvement with the national exgay movement peaked with his founding of the phoenix chapter of homosexuals anonymous ha as well as free indeed  he has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception  theres no reality in it he says i was selling a product and my product was a lie   headed up by national ministries like exodus international and courage the organizations of the exgay movement rely on the tenents of bornagain christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals  usually young gay men who are just coming out  that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing christianity  we offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality explains bob davies director of exodus  he ventures that about 80 of those seeking to abandon their homo sexuality are men   anybody who is involved in the exgay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time says lisa seeley a former redeemed lesbian who worked with caligiuri as ha and appeared with him on the sally jessy raphael show  these organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded   its possible to change your identity or your behavior says sex educator brian mcnaught author of on being gay but its really impossible to change your orientation  these people are no longer calling themselves gay but they continue to have samesex erotic feelings   caligiuri says he founded free indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life  a few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar  i was really drunk he recalls and i went home with this guy  he tied me up and raped me  he left me tied up all night and the next morning he raped me again   when caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker he returned home to the home he shared with his exlover  he had another man there with him caligiuri recalls  i thought at this time if this is what being gay is about i dont want to be this way anymore   caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out he would share his discovery with others  he organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at phoenixs gay pride parade in june 1985 and a few months later free indeed held its first public protest  at a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance free indeed members loudly blasted gays telling them ther were sinners headed for hell   free indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages  we were listed under lesbian and gay alternative services caligiuri says so people thought we were a gay information switchboard  people would call to find out where the local bars were and wed preach to them about the sins of homo sexuality  ruses like this are typical of the movement caligiuri says adding theyll do anything to reach these people   david used to go on radio and say really stupid things recalls peter kelly a counselor at phoenixs catholic diocese aids program like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors   caligiuris family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on raphaels syndicated talk show in 1985  they were relieved he recalls they figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family better that i should be a reformed gay person   but caligiuri was hardly reformed  by the time i appeared on sallys show id started having sex with men again  men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin sex with their pastor sex with their father  i was horny all the time   unable to risk going to gay bars where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances caligiuri says he used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs  when he wasnt working the bookstores he was sleeping with other reformed homosexuals   i didnt realize it at first but a lot of the ha leaders were having sex with one another caligiuri says  wed go to conferences in other cities and wed be paired up in hotel rooms  everybody was sleeping with everybody else   by the time he appeared on am philadelphia television show in may 1988 caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week  when the shows host asked him if he ever acted on temptation his answer was a lie   caligiuris duplicity began to take its toll on him however  he was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis a dibilitating yeast infection and this led to his escape from the sect  i was too sick to go to church he explains  the more time i spent away from those people the more i began to feel like myself  i began to remember who i used to be   late in 1991 caligiuri turned free indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministrys doors  id convinced myself that there is no need in the world for exgay people he says   today caligiuri 31 is studying alternative spiritualities im interest ed in belief systems that arent judgemental considering romance but not with a christian and searching for a new project to devote himself to i feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes he says  i want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what i did and make up for the damage i may have brought to our community  end article  caligiuris tory is by no means unique and i have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of exgay ministries who have said very similar th similar things  fortuantely not all of them have left christianity but have come to realize that god loves them despite the attitudes of others  some like chris glaser director of the presbyterian lazarus project of west hollywood presbyterian church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay  i have also as i said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as love in action and others who either once claimed to have been reformed or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie no matter who was disappointed in them  some were even encouraged to marry as a way of sealing their new heterosexuality only to eventually start hitting the bars bathhouses and bookstores since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and onenightstands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous sin through a committed relationship  this is a horrible trap which the church has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people and the very inno cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages  yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people 1 heterosexuality or 2 celebacy  this is sad  what is also mrtifying is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them they may even opt for suicide or surgical dampering of the brain functions  in the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common place  there are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive christianity toward gays such as sylvia penningtons exgays  there are none and others  there are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as maury johnstons gays under grace and chris glasers come hom  i seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and selfacceptance  thank you ,3

might try contacting them if you already have idl   or would be willing to buy it  its a few thousand dollars american i   expect for idl and the other should be free  those are the general   purpose packages ive heard of besides what terramar has   sips was written for aviris imagery  im not sure how general purpose   it is  you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask  i   have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification you can compute an image using selected components  ive   used it on 70 megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best   speed you need an external dsp card  it will work without it but large   images take quite a while 5070 times as long to process  thats a   freebie if you want it    my  favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems   inc  idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its   programming

applications   host configuration requirements    it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun   though there  were rumors there are always rumors that the software   would be  ported to pc and possibly a sun environment  pci    a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes   an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i   forget  the software is available in versions for msdos unix   workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly   other platforms by now  i use the vms version    the pci software consists of several classesgroupspackages of   utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci   database disk file  the tape io package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape   formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file   this is the only package i use or know much about  other packages can   display data from the pci database to one or another of several   pcisupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer eg an epsontype   dotmatrix graphics printer  you might be more spe cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and   fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg   multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store as channel 5 and   god only knows what all else  theres a lot  i dont have and dont   use these so cant say much about them you only buy the packages your   particular applicationinterest calls for    each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from   a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default   directory  some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations  the standard pci environment contains a   scripting language very similar to ibmpc basic but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  in vms i can also   invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure  theres   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the pci   data structures database file parameter file    the pci software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but   requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the   level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well  for instance the tape io package offers a   utility for reading headerless multiband what adobe photoshop on the   macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different   interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphicarts industrys ct2t format would probably i havent tried   handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what   youre doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start   over  its worth noting that the pci database file is designed to   contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of   other information i observe that a remotesensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude   longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this   can go into the pci database    i believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  on vax   systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific   thirdparty display systems the name goulddeanza seems to come to   mind  one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vctq qbus   24bit directcolor display subsystem  pci software could be overkill   in your case it seems designed for the very high end   applicationsusers ie those for whom a macpc largely doesnt suffice   although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  its   probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which   does a lot of its landresource management via remote sensing i believe   the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these   areas  spam spectral analysis manager    back in 1985 jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis   manager which got a fair amount of use at the time  that was designed   for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data  256 pixels   across by  512 lines by  256 bands a modified version has since   been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging   spectrometer which uses much larger images    spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and   ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays   actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   stretching  spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering    the original spam uses x or sunview to display  the aviris version may   require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame   buffer  i can refer you to people if youre interested  pcw requires x   for display  map ii    among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley  clrview    clrview is a

                             overview  welcome to altatheism and altatheismmoderated  this is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups  many groups of a controversial nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions misstatements or misconceptions and post them to the net  in addition people often request information which has been posted time and time again  in order to try and cut down on this the altatheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles     1  altatheism faq overview for new readers    2  altatheism faq introduction to atheism    3  altatheism faq frequently asked questions faq    4  altatheism faq constructing a logical argument    5  altatheism faq atheist resources  this is article number 1  please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting  the others are entirely optional  if you are new to usenet you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup newsannouncenewusers  the articles titled a primer on how to work with the usenet community answers to frequently asked questions about usenet and hints on writing style for usenet are particularly relevant  questions concerning how news works are best asked in newsnewusersquestions  if you are unable to find any of the articles listed above see the finding stuff section below

are free  truly free  you may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish  however please send any changes or corrections to the author and please do not repost copies of the articles to altatheism it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network                                   finding stuff  all of the faq files should be somewhere on your news system  here are some suggestions on what to do if you cant find them  1 check the newsgroup altatheism  look for subject lines starting with    altatheism faq  2 check the newsgroup newsanswers for the same subject lines     if you dont find anything in steps 1 or 2 your news system isnt set up    correctly and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem  3 if you have anonymous ftp access connect to rtfmmitedu 18172127    go to the directory pubusenetaltatheism and youll find the latest    versions of the faq files there     ftp is a a way of copying files between networked computers  if you    need help in using or getting started with ftp send email to    mailserverrtfmmitedu with        send usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq     in the body  4 there are other sites which also carry newsanswers postings  the article    introduction to the newsanswers newsgroup carries a list of these    sites the article is posted regularly to newsanswers  5 if

theres other stuff too interesting commands to try are help and    send atheismindex  6 last resort  mail mathewmantiscouk or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the faq files  you should only do this    if youve tried the above methods and theyve failed its not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or peoples mailboxes with requests for files    its better than posting without reading the faq though  for instance    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who dont have     ftp will probably need assistance obtaining the faq files   mathew ÿ ,0

photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 1bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   2  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 24bitperpixel color data instead of 8bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 2 mbyte fullcolor file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 24 bitspixel 16 million colors instead of 8 or less 256 or fewer colors  if you have only 8bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 8bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 7 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   3  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 24bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 7 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 256 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 14 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   4  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 727x525 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 6b  file9   size in bytes99comments  shipppm91145040  original file in ppm format no compression 24 bits 999 or 3 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead shipppmz9 963829  ppm file passed through unix compress 999 compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note 999 other textoriented compressors give similar results shipgif9 240438  converted to gif with ppmquant fs 256  ppmtogif 999 most of the savings is the result of losing color 999 info gif saves 8 bitspixel not 24  see sec 7  shipjpg959 155622  cjpeg q 95    highest useful quality setting 999 this is indistinguishable from the 24bit original 999 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs shipjpg759  58009  cjpeg q 75    default setting 999 you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 999 from the original even with both onscreen at once shipjpg509  38406  cjpeg q 50 999 this has slight defects if you know what to look 999 for you could tell its been jpeged without seeing 999 the original  still as good image quality as many 999 recent postings in usenet pictures groups shipjpg259  25192  cjpeg q 25 999 jpegs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent 999 at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some 999 still ive seen plenty of usenet postings that were 999 of poorer image quality than this shipjpg5o9   6587  cjpeg q 5 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead 999 blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 999 indexing purposes  note that this file is tiny 999 the compression ratio from the original is 1731   in this case jpeg can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 75 file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   5  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 95 does not mean keep 95 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 75 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 75 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 95 saying q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 95 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 50 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 75 is about right for compressing 24bit images but q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting gifs see section 14 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right  q 2 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   6  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   6a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  john bradleys free xv version 200 and up is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu or ftpcisupennedu  the file is called xvtarz where  is the version number currently 221 it is located in the contrib directory on export or the pubxv directory at upenn  xv reduces all images to 8 bits internally which means its not a real good choice if you have a 24bit display youll still get only 8bit color  also you shouldnt use xv to convert fullcolor images to jpeg because theyll get colorquantized first but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other 8bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in versions 221 and earlier be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 24bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 303  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage303tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 303 is using a hackedover v1  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli114tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 24bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os2 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 24a is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 129975050 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg24azip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386486 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 12 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv12zip  hiview requires a 386 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm386 and 386max work windows and os2 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 30  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 21 available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview21zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv2zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 860a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 25  available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw860azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic50 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg4zip or jpeg4386zip if you have a 386 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 6b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif2jpgjpg2gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 24bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 20 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif2jpg2zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy  this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats  it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 161 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsalch161zip  note about simtel20 the internets key archive site for pcrelated programs is simtel20 full name wsmrsimtel20armymil 1928811020  simtel20 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel20 that really means pd1msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel20 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 14121010117 which keeps simtel20 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel20 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 10 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 31 and 256ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version

displays jpeggiftargatiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and slideshow  the current version is 21 available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows3winjp210zip  this is a slow 286compatible version if you register youll get the 386only version which is roughly 25 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 30  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 097 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin3desktopcview097zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos  dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in fullscreen mode not in a window  os2  the following files are available from hobbesnmsuedu 12812335151

the above programs  strong 24bit display support  shareware 20  macintosh  most mac jpeg programs rely on apples jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running system 607 or later  if youre running system 6 you must also install the 32bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 7  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 1192 this file contains quicktime 15 which is better than qt 10 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 15  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 10 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 20 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 364406 file infomacappjpegview20hqx  requires system 7 and quicktime  on 8bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 40 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 232  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter232hqx  requires system 605 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert10hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v06 a jpeggif converter based on an old version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt10stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 7 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 32bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress201hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 32bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 201 or later can read and write jfifformat jpeg files use the jpeg plugin from the acquire menu  you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it  amiga  most programs listed in this

group is a volunteer organization if youd like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join   7  whats all this hoopla about color quantization  most people dont have fullcolor 24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 8bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 256orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 256 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 256color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 256 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 256color gif on a 16color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan8bit display hardware already 15bit hicolor pc displays true 24bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   8  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart13  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   9  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 100 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v4 free jpeg code you can also say sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 6 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   10  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 60 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 60 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 6a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 11 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif2jpgjpg2gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   11  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  1  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d8 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 10 followed by jfif  2  if you see ff d8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  3  hsi files start with hsi1  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  4  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it  5  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d8     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  9begin line 9mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  9begin line 9mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   12  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   13  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    14  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 3 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 12 or 13rd the size of the gif file not 14th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 75 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v4 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 10 or so when converting gifs values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 85 smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg group at jpeginfouunetuunet    999tom lane 999organizer

sirtf jpl newssoftware vaxvms vnews 141      from the jpl universe april 23 1993  sirtf is still very much in business  by mark whalen      in these times of extratight nasa budgets the very survival of a number of missions has been uncertain but thanks to major design refinements implemented in recent months jpls space infrared telescope facility sirtf  a major project considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago  is alive and well according to project scientist michael werner      a lighter spacecraft revised orbit and shorter mission have added up to a less expensive project with tremendous scientific power and a bright future said werner      designed as a followup to the highly successful infrared astronomical satellite iras and cosmic background explorer cobe missions sirtf  a cryogenically cooled observatory for infrared astronomy from space  is scheduled for launch in 2000 or 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled      iras pioneering work in spacebased infrared astronomy 10 years ago allowed astronomers to view the milky way as never before and revealed among other things 60000 galaxies and 25 comets it provided a sky survey 1000 times more sensitive than any previously available from groundbased observations cobe has measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large angular scales and revealed new facts about the early universe      but to illuminate sirtfs potential jim evans jpls manager of astrophysics and fundamental physics preprojects recently said that the project is 1000 to 1 million times more capable than iras based on technological advances in infrared detector arrays      however despite the enormous strides in infrared exploration sirtf promised and the fact that it was cited as the highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s by the national academy of sciences it took a diet or die directive from nasa headquarters last year to keep the project going according to werner      the project is now known as atlas sirtf based on the key factor in its new design the satellite will orbit the sun instead of the earth permitting the use of an atlas rocket launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier titan the main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your launch capability for boosting the payload  you dont have to carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit werner said the other advantage to a solar orbit he said is that its in a better thermal environment away from the heat of the earth      additional major changes in sirtfs redesign include shortening the mission from five to three years and building a spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original plan  atlas sirtf will weigh 2470 kilograms 5400 pounds compared to titan sirtfs 5500 kilograms 12100 pounds      all of that adds up to a less stressful launch environment werner said and a cost savings of more than 200 million for the launch in addition to increased savings in the design of the smaller less massive spacecraft      werner said sirtfs redesign came as a result of congress telling nasa youre trying to do too many things if you want us to support sirtf which is a good project develop a plan to see how it fits into nasas overall strategy      shortly thereafter sirtf was named as nasas highest priority flagship scientific mission by the interdisciplinary space sciences advisory committee in addition to the blessing from the national academy of sciences      while the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping to keep the project alive sirtfs major scientific contribution always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector arrays which will allow images to be developed tens of thousands of times faster than before according to evans      up until a couple of years ago werner said all infrared astronomy was done with single detectors  or very small arrays of individually assembled detectors since then the department of defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or hundreds of thousands of detectors rather than just a few and those are very well suited for use on sirtf      werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget pressures congress is currently watching nasa projects with an eye out for any technological spinoff      on that question i think we have some things to say he said because the detectors were using are straight off various military developments also sirtf will be built by the us aerospace industry and its a real technological and engineering challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project      sirtf will be used by the entire astronomical community werner added but the revised threeyear mission puts a premium on observing time we have to educate the user community and develop a program that involves early surveys and quick turnaround of the data      werner said the downsizing of the project required a reduction in scope and complexity of sirtfs three instruments  the infrared spectrograph infrared array camera and multiband imaging photometer however these reductions will only result in losses of efficiency rather than capability he said      the project hopes to start a phase b activity in 1995 which will provide a detailed concept for development and design building the hardware would begin about two years later      projected cost estimates evans said are 850 million950 million      i am very optimistic about sirtf he said it will provide a tremendous return for the investment      werner added that an additional benefit from the project will be the enrichment of our intellectual and cultural environment people on the street are very interested in astronomy  black holes the possibility of life on other planets the origin of the universe  and those are the kind of questions sirtf will help answer                                                               ron baalke

idea of punishment is based on the proposition that everyone knows instinctively that god exists is their creator and  ah but not everyone knows that god exists  so you have a fallacy  theres nothing terribly difficult in all this and is well known to any reasonably biblically literate christian the only controversy is  and that makes it true  holding with the bible rules out controversy read the faq  if youve read it you missed something so reread not a bad suggestion for anyonei reread it just before this  with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it means when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and dont know what he wants they contradict the bible which clearly says that everyone knows the authority of the bible is its claim to be  should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting it across  you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesnt make it any more credible to me  if the bible says that everyone knows thats clearly reason to doubt the bible because not everyone knows your alleged gods alleged existance  refuted while the specieswide condemnation is justified those that claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is no excuse  1 no they dont have to ignore the bible  the bible is far from universally accepted  the bible is not a proof of god it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god  or does it prove even that  they might have been writing it as series of fiction shortstories  as in the case of dionetics  assuming the writers believed it the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it and thats ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and biblicalphilosophers were correct  2 there are people who have truly never heard of the bible  3 again read the faq  freedom you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known in both cases that an atheist cant accept the evidence means only  bzztwrong answer gravity is directly there  it doesnt stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it  god on the other hand doesnt generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloids  god doesnt exert a rationally undeniable influence gravity is obvious gods arent  secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god so much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason always comes back to the question of god in every generation and in  no human reason hasnt always come back to the existance of god it has usually come back to the existance of god in other words it doesnt generally come back to the xtian god it comes back to whether there is any god  and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally doesnt pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there  from a worldwide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be andor what forces are currently in control  a natural tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful thinking  i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently reasonable that divine justice is just and human nature is much different than what atheists think it is whether you agree or not  xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions and its reasonableness certainly doesnt merit eminence divine justicewell it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity first not all atheists believe the same things about human nature second whether most atheists are correct or not you certainly are not correct on human nature  you are at the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach  try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity  andrew ,0

how to become an astronaut      first the short form authored by henry spencer then an official nasa     announcement      q how do i become an astronaut      a we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut since its probably     impossible for a nonrussian to get into the cosmonaut corps paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts and the other nations have     so few astronauts and fly even fewer that youre better off hoping to     win a lottery becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fastjet     experience which means a military flying career forget that unless you     want to do it anyway so you want to become a shuttle mission     specialist      if you arent a us citizen become one that is a must  after that     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply  nasas problem is not finding qualified people     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length9it is not enough     to be qualified you must avoid being disqualified for any reason     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job      get a phd  specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil  forget computer     programming entirely it will be done from the ground for the fore     seeable future  degrees in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner      be in good physical condition with good eyesight9do not get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to rked eyes and longterm     effects are poorly understood  for that matter avoid any other     significant medical unknowns  if you can pass a jetpilot physical     you should be okay if you cant your chances are poor      practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions youve got a tough selling job ahead trying     to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants  and also that you     will be a credit to nasa after you are hired  public relations is     a significant part of the job and nasas image is very prim and     proper  the image you want is squeakyclean workaholic yuppie     remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point     and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent     keep your nose clean      get a pilots license and make flying your number one hobby     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for nonpilot jobs      work for nasa of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988     43 were military or nasa employees and the remaining two were     a nasa consultant and mae jemison the first black female astronaut     if you apply from outside nasa and miss but they offer you a job     at nasa take it sometimes in the past this has meant you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first      think

including deployment     and retrieval of satellites service of existing satellites operation     of specialized laboratories astronomy earth sciences materials     processing manufacturing and other operations these missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station the orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the orbiter itself users of the space     shuttles capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries      the crew normally consists

1993 version 12  begin pgp signed message                            an introduction to atheism                        by mathew mathewmantiscouk  this article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism  whilst i have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint  i would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions some relevant books are listed in a companion article  to provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist  all the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created  some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article  please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a christian viewpoint  this is because the faq files reflect questions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christians who proselytize on altatheism  so when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such as christianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine being  much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of it may not  what is atheism  atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god some atheists go further and believe that god does not exist  the former is often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong atheism  it is important to note the difference between these two positions  weak atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god  strong atheism is a positive belief that god does not exist  please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists  some atheists believe in the nonexistence of all gods others limit their atheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than making flatout denials  but isnt disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesnt exist  definitely not  disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true  not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not  which brings us to agnosticism  what is agnosticism then  the term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of the metaphysical society in 1876  he defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable  thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether god exists  words are slippery things and language is inexact  beware of assuming that you can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic  for example many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when referring to strong atheism  beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning it is very difficult to generalize about atheists  about all you can say for sure is that atheists dont believe in god  for example it certainly isnt the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe  so what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism  there are many philosophical justifications for atheism  to find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist its best to ask her  many atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religions is essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible that such a god could exist  others are atheists through scepticism because they see no evidence that god exists  but isnt it impossible to prove the nonexistence of something  there are many counterexamples to such a statement  for example it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers  of course this deals with welldefined objects obeying welldefined rules  whether gods or universes are similarly welldefined is a matter for debate  however assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provably impossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence of god  if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexample  if on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing in question is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found to show that it isnt there  such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible  there is no such problem with largest primes because we can prove that they dont exist  therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do  even theists follow this rule most of the time they dont believe in unicorns even though they cant conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere  to assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested  we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to prove that he doesnt exist anywhere  so the sceptical atheist assumes by default that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can test  those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god exists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of god described by followers of various religions  so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may be possible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religious book does not exist  it may even be possible to prove that no god described by any presentday religion exists  in practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no god exists  however it is sufficiently different that counterarguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of god are not really applicable  but what if god is essentially nondetectable  if god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interaction must be measurable  hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable  if god is essentially nondetectable it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way  many atheists would argue that if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of no importance whether he exists or not  if the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelites surely he should still be detectable today  note that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way  it must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish him from all the other things that dont exist  ok you may think theres a philosophical justification for atheism but  isnt it still a religious belief  one of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the redefinition game  the cynical view of this game is as follows  person a begins by making a contentious statement  when person b points out that it cant be true person a gradually redefines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept  he then records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed to it and continues  eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it  rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play along  the point of this digression is that the answer to the question isnt atheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant by religious  religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power  especially in some sort of god  and by faith and worship   its worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not   religion according to such a definition   atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense  widening the definition of religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well  such as science politics and watching tv  ok so its not a religion  but surely belief in atheism or science is  still just an act of faith like religion is  firstly its not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in  secondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience  most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt  science has a number of core assumptions  for example it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers  these are the sort of core assumptions atheists make  if such basic ideas are called acts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith and the term loses its meaning  faith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in something according to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith  of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is certain  this is not a general tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists  faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof sceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit that definition as sceptical atheism has no beliefs  strong atheism is closer but still doesnt really match as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or the lack of it when asserting that god does not exist  if atheism is not religious surely its antireligious  it is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against friend or enemy  the truth is not so clearcut  atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that sense it can be said to be antireligion  however when religious believers speak of atheists being antireligious they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists  this categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum  most atheists take a live and let live attitude  unless questioned they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends  of course this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in many countries  a few atheists are quite antireligious and may even try to convert others when possible  historically such antireligious atheists have made little impact on society outside the eastern bloc countries  to digress slightly the soviet union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state just like the usa  soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished  the institution of state atheism came about when stalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population  some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business  for example the government of the usa  such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate  but if you dont allow religion to have a say in the running of the state  surely thats the same as state atheism  the principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief  in particular it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature  religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters  for example religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms  even today many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns  so long as they campaign concerning secular matters and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say  what about prayer in schools if theres no god why do you care if people  pray  because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do things that those who dont pray cant just ignore  also christian prayer in schools is intimidating to nonchristians even if they are told that they need not join in  the diversity of religious and nonreligious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event  also nonprayers tend to have friends and family who pray  it is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time even without other motives  you mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid  what about  atheists  why arent there any atheist charities or hospitals  dont  atheists object to the religious charities  there are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to  some atheists contribute to religious charities as well for the sake of the practical good they do  some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis  most atheists seem to feel that atheism isnt worth shouting about in connection with charity  to them atheism is just a simple obvious everyday matter and so is charity  many feel that its somewhat cheap not to say selfrighteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs  to weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is a rather strange idea its rather like holding a party to say today is not my birthday  why the fuss  atheism is rarely evangelical  you said atheism isnt antireligious  but is it perhaps a backlash against  ones upbringing a way of rebelling  perhaps it is for some  but many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists  its also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different  on the other hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others  on the whole we cant conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently  how do atheists differ from religious people  they dont believe in god  thats all there is to it  atheists may listen to heavy metal  backwards even  or they may prefer a verdi requiem even if they know the words  they may wear hawaiian shirts they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes  many buddhists lack a belief in any sort of god  some atheists even carry a copy of the bible around  for arguing against of course  whoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it  atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance  unexceptional but arent atheists less moral than religious people  that depends  if you define morality as obedience to god then of course atheists are less moral as they dont obey any god  but usually when one talks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society  humans are social animals and to be maximally successful they must cooperate with each other  this is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from antisocial or immoral behaviour purely for the purposes of selfpreservation  many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans  so why do they care what happens to others  they dont know they simply are that way  naturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their actions  however there are equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions  for example    here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance jesus christ    came into the world to save sinners  but for that very reason i was    shown mercy so that in me  jesus christ might display his unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life  now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god    be honor and glory forever and ever  the above quote is from a statement made to the court on february 17th 1992 by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee wisconsin  it seems that for every atheist massmurderer there is a religious massmurderer  but what of more trivial morality     a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior    deteriorated after born again experiences  while only 4 of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being born again 12 had done    so after conversion  similarly 5 had used illegal drugs before    conversion 9 after  two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation 5 after                                 freethought today september 1991 p 12  so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour  is there such a thing as atheist morality  if you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then the answer is yes as explained above  many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people  if you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer is no  atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave  most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists but for different reasons  atheists view morality as something created by humans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being  then arent atheists just theists who are denying god  a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over 90 of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them  they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them  atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they are unbelievers through choice  the vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth  they have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs  this decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individuals personality  for a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make  but dont atheists want to believe in god  atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them  many of them have no desire to be watched over no matter how goodnatured the big brother figure might be  some atheists would like to be able to believe in god  but so what should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true  the risks of such an approach should be obvious  atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough there must be evidence for the belief  but of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god  they are  unwilling in their souls to see  many if not most atheists were previously religious  as has been explained above the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god exists  many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach god  of course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedminded comments such as of course god is there you just arent looking properly are likely to be viewed as patronizing  certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for god  if you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate is futile  isnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist  many atheists live a purposeful life  they decide what they think gives meaning to life and they pursue those goals  they try to make their lives count not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on other people who will live on  for example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leaving his mark on history  it is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random events  however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing that has a meaning  to put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask  some atheists believe that asking what is the meaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup of coffee  they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just is  so how do atheists find comfort in time of danger  there are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even pets or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tv  that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what  should individuals believe in things because they are comforting or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be  in the end its a decision for the individual concerned  most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable  they put truth before comfort and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy thats just hard luck  dont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong  the short answer is no do you  many atheists have been atheists for years  they have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive  thousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof of the existence of god  atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about it  so why should theists question their beliefs dont the same arguments  apply  no because the beliefs being questioned are not similar  weak atheism is the sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing  strong atheism is a negative belief  theism is a very strong positive belief  atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause  not just to the believers but to everyone else  what sort of harm  religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind  its not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings think of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so on imagine how that effort could be better spent  many theists believe in miracle healing  there have been plenty of instances of ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result  some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds  it is arguable that the catholic churchs opposition to birth control  and condoms in particular  is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many thirdworld countries and contributing to the spread of aids worldwide  religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion  those werent real believers  they just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse  what makes a real believer  there are so many one true religions its hard to tell  look at christianity there are many competing groups all convinced that they are the only true christians  sometimes they even fight and kill each other  how is an atheist supposed to decide whos a real christian and who isnt when even the major christian churches like the catholic church and the church of england cant decide amongst themselves  in the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who calls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify his actions should be considered a christian  maybe some of those christians are just perverting christian teaching for their own ends  but surely if the bible can be so readily used to support unchristian acts it cant be much of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldnt he have made it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefs arent a perversion of what your god intended  if there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your sayso sorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murdered others because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him a christian  obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned  but since  nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsense  that does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones  nobody has ever proved that unicorns dont exist but that doesnt make it unlikely that they are myths  it is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default  of course weak atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still  well if atheisms so great why are there so many theists  unfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct it is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudosciences  many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods  certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand  of course theres more to religion than that  in the industrialized world we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations  religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves other purposes as well  but so many cultures have developed religions  surely that must say  something  not really  most religions are only superficially similar for example its worth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort of concept of god in the christian sense  of course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so its rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another  what about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that god exists  for every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one who does not  besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it  also it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders  a famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight  many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise  so are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing  not entirely  it certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far  the theory of memetics talks of memes  sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds by analogy with genes  some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others  some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressure to keep onetime believers from admitting that they were mistaken  some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes  of course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme  religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it  even if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important  messages  what are the fundamental messages of atheism  there are many important ideas atheists promote  the following are just a few of them dont be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions     there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules     be especially sceptical of positive claims     if you want your life to have some sort of meaning its up to you to    find it     search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable     make the most of your life as its probably the only one youll have     its no good relying on some external power to change you you must change    yourself     just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good     if you must assume something assume something its easy to test     dont believe things just because you want them to be true  and finally and most importantly     all beliefs should be open to question

usenet or bitnet electronic mail may be sent     between these networks and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special servers      the space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them      one mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list in     addition to the general lists for space called space digest for     internet users and space on bitnet there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below      a second mechanism is usenet netnews this is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     group name the groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called scispacenews scispace scispaceshuttle sciastro     and talkpoliticsspace contributors post submissions called     articles in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends     it to other nearby machines similarly articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted      gateway machines redirect the usenet scispace group into internet and     bitnet mailing lists and vice versa the other usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists if you can receive netnews its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred

redesign deleted  mark proposed this design at joe sheas committee in crystal city and he reports that he was warmly received  however the rumors i hear say that a design based on a wingless space shuttle orbiter seems more likely  yo ken lets keep ontop of things both the external tank and wingless orbiter options have been deleted from the ssf redesign options list todays 423 edition of the new york times reports that oconnor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped such as using the giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles and building a station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed  currently there are three options being considered as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday and as reported in todays times  option a  low cost modular approach this option is being studied by a team from msfc as an aside there are ssf redesign teams at msfc jsc and larc supporting the srt station redesign team in crystal city both lerc and reston folks are also onsite at these locations helping the respective teams with their redesign activities key features of this option are     uses bus1 a modular bus developed by lockheed thats      qualified for sts and elvs the bus provides propulsion gnc      communications  data management lockheed developed this      for the air force     a power station capability is obtained in 3 shuttle flights      ssf solar arrays are used to provide 20 kw of power the vehicle      flies in an arrow mode to optimize the microgravity environment      shuttlespacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions     human tended capability as opposed to the old ssf sexist term      of mantended capability is achieved by the addition of the      us common module this is a modified version of the existing      ssf lab module docking ports are added for the international      partners labs taking the place of the nodes on ssf the      shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions      the orbiter would provide crew habitability  eva capability     international human tended add the nasda  esa modules and      add another 20 kw of power     permanent human presence capability add a 3rd power module      the us habitation module and an acrv assured crew return      vehicle  option b  space station freedom derived the option b team is based at larc and is lead by mike griffin this option looks alot like the existing ssf design which we have all come to know and love   this option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all ssf assembly flights so does option a also the  number of flights is computed for a 516 inclination orbit for both options a and b  the buildup occurs in six phases     initial research capability reached after 3 flights power      is transferred from the vehicle to the orbiterspacelab when      it visits     mantended capability griffin has not yet adopted nonsexist      language is achieved after 8 flights the us lab is      deployed and 1 solar power module provides 20 kw of power     permanent human presence capability occurs after 10 flights by      keeping one orbiter onorbit to use as an acrv so sometimes      there would be two orbiters onorbit  the acrv and the      second one that comes up for logistics  resupply     a two fault tolerance capability is achieved after 14 flights      with the addition of a 2nd power module another thermal      control system radiator and more propulsion modules     after 20 flights the internationals are onboard more power      the habitation module and an acrv are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights  most of the systems currently on ssf are used asis in this option  with the exception of the data management system which has major changes  option c  single core launch station this is the jsc lead option basically you take a 23 ft diameter cylinder thats 92 ft long slap 3 space shuttle main engines on the backside put a nose cone on the top attached it to a  regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket motors and launch the can some key features are    complete endtoend ground integration and checkout    4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels    body mounted radiators which adds protection against     micrometeroid  orbital debris    2 centerline docking ports one on each end    7 berthing ports    a single pressurized volume approximately 26000 cubic feet     twice the volume of skylab    7 floors center passageway between floors    10 kw of housekeeping power    graceful degradation with failures 8 power channels 4 thermal     loops dual environmental control  life support system    increased crew time for utilization

kelvinjplnasagov keywords vlbi jpl newssoftware vaxvms vnews 141      from the jpl universe april 23 1993  vlbi project meets with international space agencies  by ed mcnevin      members of jpls space very long baseline interferometry vlbi project team recently concluded a weeklong series of meetings with officials from russia and japan      the meetings were part of space vlbi week held at jpl in early march and were intended to maintain cooperation between international space agencies participating in the development of the us space vlbi project a recently approved jpl flight project set for launch in 1995      us space vlbi will utilize two earthorbiting spacecraft  the japanese vsop vlbi space observing program satellite with its 8meter radio telescope and a russian radioastron 10meter satellite both spacecraft will team up with groundbased radio telescopes located around the world to create a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio telescope observing power by a factor of 10      japans vsop satellite will use a limited sixhour orbit to conduct imaging science while the russian radioastron spacecraft will exploit a larger 28hour earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy each satellite will point at a source target for roughly 24 hours while approximately 20 groundbased radio telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on earth      according to dr joel smith jpls project manager for the us space vlbi meetings like those held at jpl will permit japan and russia who have little previous experience in radio interferometry to establish working relationships with the radio astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex observations required by the space vlbi project      one of our main activities is developing the methodology for international coordination because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while using the groundbased radio telescopes to observe the same celestial objects said smith      three new tracking antennas are being built at dsn facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in japan russia and green bank wva this global network of groundbased radio telescopes will use precision clocks and highspeed recorders to collect observation data and forward the information to a correlator located at the national radio astronomy observatory in socorro nm the correlator will combine and process data then make it available to mission investigators in moscow tokyo and jpl via electronic mail      smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created by the space vlbi network will provide radio astronomers with better resolution than has ever been achieved before by groundbased radio telescopes allowing astronomers to take a closer look at distant objects in space      there is a long history of radio astronomy using groundbased telescopes said smith what we intend to do is to extend radio astronomy into earth orbit our goal is to look deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei quasars and other active radio sources to understand what drives those things we have seen so far with radio astronomy      smith noted that if one examines the active galactic nuclei youll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than light and at energy levels that are millions of times greater than you would expect      he said some astronomers believe that black holes may be located in the cores of these galaxies and that they may fuel the jets smith hopes that by using space vlbi to look further into the cores this theory may be supported or disproved      russian spaceflight hardware including transponders and transmitters are now being tested in the united states and japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this year analysis of this hardware will permit us scientists and engineers to understand how to modify the highspeed vlba correlator operating at the nrao in order to accommodate the odd data patterns that will originate from the more than 20 groundbased radio telescopes involved in space vlbi      smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the japanese and russian space agency officials  like those held at jpl in march  have proceeded smoothly yet he knows that the political uncertainty in russia could jeopardize that countrys participation in the project      nothing is ever smooth he said but the russians have been incredibly open with us we always anticipated some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors beyond our control yet there tends to be a way of keeping these things going because scientists on both sides are trying hard and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level      smith points out that the japanese space agency has more at stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a science mission      the japanese have been extremely cooperative since international cooperation is essential to their science mission he said      but smith also noted that japanese space agency officials look at the us space vlbi mission as an opportunity to showcase the technology involved with vsop spacecraft and their highly regarded mach v launch vehicle      yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an ambitious project jpls smith is satisfied that planning for the space vlbi project is beyond the significant financial and political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project      fortunately we have the virtue of having two partners and if either falls out we would still have something with the other by themselves both spacecraft are independent scientifically exciting missions

rocket ship last saturday  the company hopes this singlestage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a singlestagetoorbit ssto rocket ship          the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands missile range in new mexico this week  flight tests will start in midjune          although there wasnt a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for ssto research remains cloudy  the sdi organization  which paid 60 million for the dcx  cant itself afford to fund full development of a followon vehicle  to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a suborbital dcxa sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies          sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of spacebased sensors and weapns  however recent changes in sdis political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto less of a priority  today the agency is more interested in using dcx as a step towards a lowcost reusable sounding rocket          sdio has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies said col  simon pete worden sdios deputy for technology  but worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program i didnt make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i have available to spend he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell douglas astronautics headquarters          while sdio has lowered its sights on the programs orbital objective agency officials hail the dcx as an example of the better faster cheaper approach to hardware development  the agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of evolutionary technology developments          worden said the dcx illustrates how a build a little test a little approach can produce results on time and within budget  he said the program  which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months  showed how todays engineers could move beyond the miracles of our parents time          the key is management worden said sdio had a very light hand on this project  we had only one overworked major jess sponable          although the next phase may involve more agencies worden said lean management and a sense of governmentindustry partnership will be crucial its essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially          sdios approach also won praise from two california members of the house science space and technology committee this is the direction were going to have to go said rep  george brown the committees democratic chairman programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years arent sustainablenasa hasnt learned it yet  sdio has          rep  dana rohrbacher browns republican colleague went further joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency          rohrbacher whose orange county district includes mcdonnell douglas also criticized nasaair force work on conventional multistaged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology lets not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top  lets build a spaceship           although rohrbacher praised sdios sponsorship he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology          mcdonnell douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its c17 transport and space station freedom programs were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment on very large ventures companies put in seed money said charles ordahl mcdonnell douglas senior vice president for space systems you need strong government investments          while the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the dcxa they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development  citing corporate history they liken the process to douglas aircrafts dc aircraft  just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the dc3 transport a gradual evolution in singlestage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper dc1          flight tests this summer at white sands will expand the envelope of performance with successive tests increasing speed and altitude  the first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering verticle takeoff and landing  the second series will send the unmanned dcx up to 5000 feet  the third and final series will take the craft up to 20000 feet          maneuvers will become more complex on third phase  the final tests will include a pitchover manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottomdown configuration for a soft fourlegged landing          the flight test series will be supervised by charles pete conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo 12 moon landing now a mcdonnell douglas vice president conrad paised the vehicles aircraftlike approach to operations  features include automated checkout and access panels for easy maintainance          if the program moves to the next stage engine technology will become a key consideration  this engine would have more thrust than the pratt  whitney rl10a5 engines used on the dcx  each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14760 pounds of thrust          based on the engine used in centaur upper stages the a5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and threetoon throttling capability  it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround          worden said future singlestage rockets could employ tripropellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union the resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes          the mechanism for the teaming may already be in place  pratt has a technology agreement with npo energomash the design bureau responsible for the tripropellant and energia cryogenic

ra in article c5elp2l0cacsubuffaloedu ra psyrobtwubvmsbccbuffaloedu robert weiss says ra     just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing you refer to  differing interpretations of create and say that many christians may  not agree so what that is really irrelevant we do not base our faith  on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line is  truth regardless of popularity of opinions  it may be irrelevant to you and your personal beliefs or should i say bias but it is relevant to me and many others  youre right the bottom line is truth independant from you or anyone else  since you proclaim truths as a selfproclaimed appointee may i ask you by what authority you do this  because it says so in the bible  does the bible say so or is it you or someone else who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or disapproval  excuse moi but your line of truths havent moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous  of all the preachers of truth on this net you have struck me as a selfrighteous member of the wrecking crew with no positive message to me or any other latterday saint btw this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by jesus to the pharisees ye hypocrites    ye preach about me with your lips but your hearts are far removed from me   also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created  and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the mormon  belief you cant grant your conclusion and then expect the point to  have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address  and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the  conclusion that you grant  sophistry  look whos talking jumping to conclusions  you wouldnt do that yourself right  all you address is your own convictions regardless whether we come up with any biblical scriptures which supports our points of view because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever    the bible states that lucifer was created  the bible states that jesus  is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds  belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same  a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine  the former kgb would have loved to employ you jesus and lucifer are not the same silly and you know it     the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is  nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible  says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god  correction it may contradict would you think the bible says  the bible indeed does teach that not all are children of god in the sense that they belong to or follow god in his footsteps  satan and his followers have rebelled against god and are not children followersredeemed of god but it doesnt mean that they were not once created by god but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow god and his plan of salvation           the field is the world the good seed are the children of the         kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one         matthew 1338  so  this illustrates nicely what i just said the children of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of jesus and have shown works of repentance etc and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against god and the lamb  the issue of satans spiritorigin and of those who followed him has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your bible  you purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your right with non related scriptures  lots of nice scriptures deleted not robert w copyrighted though  ra  we are told that and this is life eternal that they might know ra  thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent ra  john 173 life eternal is to know the only true god yet the ra  doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly ra  different jesus a jesus that cannot be reconciled with the jesus of ra  the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim  correction my jesus is indeed different than your jesus and can be reconciled with the jesus in the bible  not your interpretation of him i concur but i honestly couldnt care less  ra  one as being true denies the other from being true according to the ra  bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god and ra  not the construct of imagination  in this single posting of yours ive seen more constructs of imagination than in all of the prolds mails combined i have read so far in this news group  first get your ldsfacts straight before you dare preaching to us about the only true god whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes but whose image i cannot reconcile with what i know about him myself  i guess your grandiose selfimage does not allow for other faiths believing in the divinity of jesus christ but in a different way or fashion than your own  not that it really matters the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visited every continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear    this is really a red herring it doesnt address any issue raised but   rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read   something into the bible doesnt change what the bible teaches  sigh  what the bible teaches  or what the bible teaches according to robert weiss and co  i respect the former i reject the latter without the remotest feeling that i have rejected jesus  on the contrary  and by the way i do respect your interpretations of the bible i even grant you being a christian following your own image of him as much as i am a christian following my own image of him in my heart      most of the other replies have instead hopscotched to the issue of   bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine i dont   think that it matters if mcconkies views were canon that is not the   issue  were mcconkies writings indicative of mormon belief on this   subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may   certainly be  the issue is of course that you love to use anything to either mis represent or ridicule the lds church  the issue of official doctrine is obviously very important  mcconkies views have been controversial eg the seven deadly heresies has made me a heretic   at best or erroneous at worst blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation  i respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church but i personally do not rely on his personal interpretations his book mormon doctrine is oftentimes referred to as mcconkies bible in mormon circles on mormon doctrine  i rather look to official doctrinal sources and to hugh nibleys books the last comment is an ldsinsider reference  summarizing mcconkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of god than i have but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation  but having said this i find mcconkie even in his most biased and speculative moments far more thoughtprovoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen  im somewhat appalled that i have allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting   robert weiss psyrobtwubvmsccbuffaloedu   casper c knies

1993,1993,from keithccocaltechedu keith allan schneider subject re pompous ass organization california institute of technology pasadena lines 226 nntppostinghost lloydcaltechedu  mvs104psuvmpsuedu writes  many people would probably think especially if the fanatics propogandized this that this was a conflict between the atheists and the religious many would get the impression that we were trying to outlaw religion if we contintue to try to remove all things with a religious reference thats not what the people ive asked think perhaps you would be right if you said the fundamentalists would think this way after all they think they are being oppressed when they are not allowed to oppress however you have not shown where you get this idea that many people would probably think its atheism vs religion winner take all as far as i can tell it is your groundless prediction that this will happen  but you havent taken into the account of propoganda  remember if you asked germans before wwii if the jews shoudl be slaughtered they would probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at least some were able to tolerate it  you see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy  the propoganda machines have been in gear over a number of issues including abortion and gays  look at some of the things that have happened well so far they have passed one amendment which is currently under intense scrutiny and they have failed to outlaw abortion which is their prime goal on that issue yep they seem sooo effective sure  well they havent managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts  but they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion  they could create similar problems for us  and it could be worse  they can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics etc but imagine what theyd have to do to stop atheism  besides the margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people better than your one that is your opinion also i have branched out and the informal survey is up over half a dozen now and what have they said  were you questions unbiased keith you would claim that my questions are biased the minute i posted them because the answers agreed with me everyone i have asked about the possible removal of the motto the christian portion has expressed regret about its loss because they like it however when it is pointed out to them that a new motto will not be in the works none have expressed the desire to rape murder pillage etc which you have basically claimed  so you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of them  a whole nation  as for the atheist portion i know some around here they have all expressed disgust with the motto some noted being harassed by christians who used the motto to try to seem justified and all would see it gone  yes id be glad if it were gone to  ive never supported it  however i think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted with what could happen an what may be likely  which christians designed the motto  does the motto say anything about jesus  why do you think that it refers only to christians christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and all others are wrong therefore why would they include other religions in the realm of being correct i doubt that any other religions were meant to be included  well i am not clear on the religious convictions of francis scott key the motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed in a god  and surely there are a few christians that think as you say but i dont think that most do  do you think that all christians actively despise other religions  most that i have met havent and dont do so  no christian that i have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them why not ask some people of other faiths sorry i would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here suppose you could ask a few people  well i have asked a hindu moselem and a few jews and all of them think that it is applicable to them  of course i cant say that these people just some that i know pretty well are accurate representations of their faiths  it is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting views on any given issue  you are assuming that all the views were the same and nothing leads to this conclusion without evidence to the contrary i doubt that there were dissenting opinions you claim there were provide some evidence for your assertion  well id really like to and ive tried but i really dont know where to get access to congressional records from the 1950s  can anyone help out here  comparing christians to nazis interesting  only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs  no again the motto on the money doesnt cost you anything extra  however if you abolished the motto wed all have to pay to have all the dies and plates redone like people paid before to get them changed to have the motto on them you now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again   also i doubt that they use th3 same plates for more than a years printing this would make it easy to remove the motto simply make next years plates without it your claim evidently is that they will have to pay extra somewhere provide some evidence for this assertion  so are you saying that they redesign the plates each year  anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted i see was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money  this is just not correct  the ones i read didnt mention anything about jesus  i think the issue was concerning the distinction between religion and not how could it be between religious and not religious the motto refers to god it is a religious motto the question is whether or not it is only christian you say it is more i doubt this provide some evidence for this assertion  that is to say the religion of this country and the nonreligion of the ussr  that was what most of those quotes were about and some included all atheists in general as well  i dont think that any of the quotes although i seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about jesus they advocated religion over nonreligion  a specific religion was not mentioned  you have missed this point  i said that the motto didnt say anything about anyone in particular  that is the motto doesnt imply anything about your particular beliefs  it doesnt say that everyone trusts in some form of god only that the nation on the whole does we have been through this before its obvious it does not include me this much is beyond doubt your claim again is that the motto refers to more than christians based on the facts that christianity says all other religions are wrong and because it seems that the motto was written by christians i doubt your claim  so you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong  thats silly i think the flatearthers are wrong but i dont advocate their banishment    based on this idea i doubt that any additional expense would even be incurred by removing the motto provide some evidence for your claim that it would  i think that any such cost would be insignificant  i mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency  disregarding the digression of the other mottoif it is used for harassment and no other purpose has been found for it why should it not be removed  well mottos in general dont really have purposes  i dont think it should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences  and do you know what the vote was  were there other opinions  do you think that the main reason the motto was required by law was to bother atheists  do you think that this is what the majority of congress at the time had in mind  if you do then show why again it is the opinion of the people who put it there that i am concerned with  then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress  again it is not necessary that the complete majority shared the purpose of confronting godless communism with this motto  why not  it is the majority that put it there  the general public probably does not know about the antiatheist intent of a few people in the 50s either i daresay more people remember the 50s than the time when key wrote the anthem  but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto  do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists  why dont you include this in your little survey that you were conducting   you claim here that scientists would believe someones claims i doubt this provide evidence for your assertion  what  should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein said about relativity is worthy  i mean if einstein said it theres a good chance that it was right at least at the time  as for the courts the method scientists use can be applied i need not agree with the court by default because of a good record  you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point  what  but you said you didnt agree with the court because they allowed congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning  if you dont realize that something like this is external to the realm of the courts power then how can i be confident that you know anything about the courts powers  i mean if you dont know how the court works how can you participate in a discussion of the court a judge can go to speak before congress and still you ignore the abortion gag rule as you make your claims on abortion  no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a constitutional amendment  and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be presented  mushrooms flowers trees buildings signs whatever  the analogy is the same  just because something that i might find offensive is present doesnt mean that my rights are being violated we are talking about something put there by people keithnot a mushroom no one caused that mushroom to exist unless youre finding things offensive in a mushroom farm  yes some mushrooms can be planted  and i dont appreciate mushrooms on my pizza either  this is not the case with the motto and youre ignoring the harassment which is the only known result of the motto and youre ignoring that somewhere along the line people were forced to put the motto there  who was forced to put the motto there  what do you mean  keith ,0

usa monday april 5 1993 san jose mercury news page 1      reproduced without permission  3700year tradition still glows              assimilation in us threatens ancient zoroastrian religion  by jeanne huber mercury news staff writer     high on a hillside above san jose flames leap up 24 hours a day from a gleaming brass urn in a temple  one of only four in the united states  dedicated to one of the worlds most ancient religions     with the flames go the prayers of about 1200 bay area zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land     there is a fear  a real fear too said silloo tarapore of lafayette we have one generation to do it or to die     many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land but for zoroastrians it is an especially poignant concern     their religion has been around for perhaps 3700 years a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where historical sites are sometimes less than 100 years old  it was the religion of the great persian empire under kings cyrus and darius  and tradition says that when christ was born about 500 years later he was honored by a visit from three zoroastrian priests the magi  scholars say many key beliefs of christians jews and muslims can be traced to the teachings of zoroaster the zoroastrian prophet     yet with only about 150000 zoroastrians in the entire world they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live  survival as a people is very much on their minds     ironically local zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the united states may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1000 years of benign religious segregation could not do cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as zoroastrians     zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts  so if their children become totally assimilated they say its their children  rather than the world at large  who will be the losers     its important to have an identity said maneck bhujwaia of san jose a leader among zoroastrians who came here from india  its important for everybody  irish scottish americans  it gives meaning to life you dont have to depend on the majority community to give you respect you can fall back on your own identity     for zoroastrians theres much to be proud of     their prophet zoroaster seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common preached that there was only one god a good one  zoroastrians call their god ahura mazda which translates as lord of wisdom and light  good vs evil     zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil with the good eventually winning  men and women could join in the battle for good he said and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong  he preached honesty charity kindness to animals respect for the environment hard work equality of men and women  basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions     but zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly  he demanded they think for themselves  in fact joseph campbell the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths traced the western emphasis on individual thought to the zoroastrians     zoroastrians have many words for thought  their motto leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of mount hamilton is good thoughts good words good deeds     so its not surprising that zoroastrians value education highly  in india where a contingent of zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by muslims in iran zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy the overall statistic in india is just 60 percent     about half of the bay area zoroastrian community came here from india and pakistan mostly to study at universities  the other half fled from iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist islamic state where others had no rights     local zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on good deeds has improved life in every country they inhabit  in san jose the recent restoration of the hotel sainte clarie came about because manou mobedshahi a san franciscobased hotelier passed the boardedup downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple  at the temples dedication the chief guest of honor was the mother of zubin mehta the zoroastrian conductor of the new york philharmonic orchestra     the temple exists because of another good deed the decision by an iranian emigre the late arbab rustom guiv to buy land for six temples in north america  besides the 10acre site off crothers road on mount hamilton he paid for land in los angeles chicago new york toronto and vancouver  until his gifts there were no zoroastrian temples on this continent     local zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center     the temple dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  zoroaster is a simple structure with gleaming white walls vaulted  ceilings and oak floors partially covered with huge oriental carpets     its central feature is the fire set in the middle of a partlyglassed in area at the center of the building  although zoroastrians are  sometimes called fire worshippers they actually consider fire just  a symbol of god  it helps us concentrate just like christians use the  cross and muslims use the holy book bhujwala said     the biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring  for all iranians including zoroastrians the new year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life  with zoroasters birthday just six days later the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the united states celebrates between christmas and jan 1    for this years celebration of the prophets birthday about 500 people came to worship and revel     the good things in life are not forbidden esfandiar anoushiravani a leader of the iranian members had said beforehand and what followed proved him right     inside the temple worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a halfdozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood glasses of milk and water and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts     kids crowded around grabbing handfuls of the treats  people eat the fruit tarapore said  its a way to participate in the ceremony  santa claus sort of     the gathering even had a santa claus iranian style  with flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children this amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring and red     he was ushed in by a sort of spring clown hajefyrouz who danced and played a tambourine     the zoroastrians from india were charmed  this is all new for us too one told a visitor who asked what was going on     a visitor john a sabanovich of folsom said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to iran  zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts  a result some say of their centuries of persecution in iran followed by their promise to the hindu king who allowed them into india that they would not interfere with his peoples religion     but that does not stop sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the san jose temple whenever he can     when i first heard about this religion he said i thought my god this is what a religion should be  they think for themselves and do good     people who dont have a tradition something to lean on whats the difference with the lower animals   end of article   ,3
